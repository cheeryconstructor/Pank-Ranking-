Hundreds dead in Nepal quake, avalanche triggered on Everest

Historic Kathmandu tower collapses in quake, scores feared trapped

Kathmandu (AFP) April 25, 2015 - An historic 19th-century tower collapsed in the heart of Kathmandu's old quarter after an earthquake on Saturday, with at least a dozen bodies seen pulled from the rubble and fears of scores still trapped. Kathmandu (AFP) April 25, 2015 - An historic 19th-century tower collapsed in the heart of Kathmandu's old quarter after an earthquake on Saturday, with at least a dozen bodies seen pulled from the rubble and fears of scores still trapped. The nine-storey Dharhara tower is a major tourist attraction in Durbar Square at the heart of Kathmandu's historic old city where kings were once crowned, with its eighth-floor balcony providing panoramic views of the Kathmandu valley. The tower -- which was white, topped with a bronze minaret and contained a spiral staircase of over 200 steps -- was reduced to just its base when the 7.8-magnitude quake struck at lunchtime. Rescue workers were seen dragging bodies from the rubble and TV footage showed chaotic scenes at the site, as people desperately tried to dig through piles of bricks and dust with their bare hands. Kathmandu police spokesman Dinesh Acharya said rescuers were frantically trying to ""bring everyone out to safety"". ""Our team is still deployed in Dharara to rescue people. However, we do not know how many are still trapped,"" he told AFP. People took to social media to express their dismay at the historic site's collapse. ""Devastating to see Dharhara (Bhimsen Tower) collapsed,"" user Prabir Bhatt said on Twitter. ""The historic #Dharhara tower in #Nepal destroyed by the #Earthquake. Prayers!"" wrote Rahul Sharma. Saturday was not the first time the 50.5-metre-high tower -- built by Nepal's then prime minister for the queen in 1832 -- has been hit by an earthquake. Much of Durbar Square, a UNESCO World Heritage site and the social and cultural heart of the city, had to be rebuilt after a huge quake in 1934. The tower collapsed in that quake and was rebuilt two stories lower than the original. The tower was a popular attraction, with tourists charged a small fee to climb the steps to the viewing deck. A small shrine to the Hindu god Shiva was located at the top. The Wikipedia page for the tower was updated within minutes after the earthquake hit, with the news of its collapse. A massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake killed hundreds of people Saturday as it ripped through large parts of Nepal, toppling office blocks and towers in Kathmandu and triggering an avalanche that hit Everest base camp. Officials said at least 449 people are known to have died in Nepal but that the toll could be much higher, while more than two dozen people were also reported killed in neighbouring India, China and Bangladesh. ""The death toll based on information received on our network across the country has reached 449,"" Nepal's national police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam told AFP. ""Deaths have been reported from all regions except the far west. All our security personnel have been deployed to rescue and assist those in need."" Officials said an avalanche had buried parts of Mount Everest's base camp in Nepal where hundreds of mountaineers have gathered at the start of the annual climbing season. ""An avalanche from Mt. Pumori has hit the base camp, burying a part of it,"" Gyanendra Kumar Shrestha, an official in Nepal's tourism department, told AFP. ""We are trying to assess how many are injured. There might be over 1,000 people there right now, including foreign climbers and Nepalese supporting staff."" AFP Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly, on an assignment to Everest, was among those caught up in the chaos and reported that snowfall meant it was impossible for helicopters to reach the area. Two experienced mountaineers said that panic erupted at base camp which was full of climbing teams and had been ""severely damaged"", while one said the quake triggered a ""huge avalanche"". -- Historic tower collapses -- But the worst damage was reported in Kathmandu, where the historic nine-storey Dharahara tower, a major tourist attraction, was among the buildings to have been brought down. At least a dozen bodies were taken away from the ruins of the 19th century tower, according to an AFP photographer who saw similar scenes of multiple casualties in other parts of the city. While contact with Nepal was sporadic, a senior Nepalese diplomat warned that the final toll could run into many hundreds. ""We have received reports that there is a big loss of property and life in Nepal,"" Krishna Prasad Dhakal, the deputy chief of mission at Nepal's Embassy in New Delhi, told AFP. ""Possibly hundreds of people have died in various parts of the country, particularly in Kathmandu and Pokhara."" At least 26 people were known to have died in India, including 17 in the eastern state of Bihar, while buildings in the capital New Delhi had to be evacuated. The United States Geological Survey and India's meteorological service said the shallow quake struck 77 kilometres (48 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 0611 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside their homes. ""The walls of houses have collapsed around me onto the road. All the families are outside in their yards huddled together,"" an AFP reporter said in Kathmandu. Another resident recounted scenes of panic and mayhem. ""Everything started shaking. Everything fell down. The walls around the main road have collapsed. The national stadium's gates have collapsed,"" Anupa Shrestha said. The quake tore through the middle of highways in the capital and also caused damage to the country's only international airport which was briefly closed. Kari Cuelenaere, an official at the Dutch embassy, said the impact had swept the water out of a swimming pool at a Kathmandu hotel where Dutch national day was being celebrated. ""It was horrible, all of a sudden all the water came up out of the pool and drenched everyone, the children started screaming,"" Cuelenaere told AFP. ""Some parts of the city fell down, there was dust rising... There were many (rescue) helicopters. Aftershock tremors could be felt more than two hours after the initial quake. Initially measured at 7.5 magnitude, the quake was later adjusted to 7.8, with a depth of 15 kilometres, the USGS said. It hit 73 kilometres east of the tourist town of Pokhara. - Tremors felt across region - Witnesses and media reports said the tremors lasted between 30 seconds and two minutes. ""We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal,"" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet. The AFP office in Delhi was evacuated twice following the quake. China's official Xinhua news agency said that two people, including an 83-year-old woman, were killed in the Tibet region as a result of the quake. The earthquake was also felt across large areas of Bangladesh, triggering panic in the capital Dhaka as people rushed out onto the streets. In the garment manufacturing hub of Savar, on the outskirts of Dhaka, at least 50 workers were injured after the quake set off a stampede in a garment factory, according to the private Jamuna television. The area has a history of earthquakes, with a 6.8 magnitude quake that hit eastern Nepal in August 1988 killing 721 people. A magnitude 8.1 quake killed 10,700 people in Nepal and eastern India in 1934. Deadliest earthquakes of the past 30 years

The Bangladesh embassy in Nepal has opened a ‘help desk’ for its nationals after a massive earthquake reportedly killed many in the Himalayan nation.

Ambassador Mashfee Binte Shams said that the main tourist attractions in the capital Kathmandu, Thamel and Pokhara were the worst hit, but they were not getting “much information” about damage and casualties.

“We’re working and in close touch with local authorities. We have opened a help desk,” she said, urging all to contact the desk if necessary.

She said Bangladeshis mostly travel to Nepal as a tourist destination. “There are roughly 100 families (Bangladeshi) living here. But they all are safe”.

Mitchell Pineo is a DJ and is in Nepal in tour. He had just played a show in Kathmandu Friday night and was having lunch outside the city when the quake struck.

“We felt this really low rumble. It was absolutely terrifying,” he said.

“We jumped up and everything around us starting shaking. People started screaming and running into the street.”

“We followed suit and ran. We tried to stay away from anything that could potentially collapse,” he said.

Pineo describes a solemn scene.

“Entire villages have been completely leveled. Buildings are not really well supported. There are just rows and rows of them completely flat.”

He describes the shaking as “intense” and said there were aftershocks for an hour afterward, adding many people are still on edge.

As he and his friends made their way back into Kathmandu, he said the destruction and rubble got dramatically worse.

“The military was setting up all sorts of different camps in the parks for the casualties. We saw lots of excavators and soldiers trying to dig people up. Their families surrounding them. The families crying out in agony when they pulled their loved one from the wreckage. It was difficult to see.”

Pineo said he has not slept since Friday and is spending the night outside the city away from tall buildings.

The trip to Nepal is supposed to last for another two weeks. Pineo said that while his family would like him to come home, he plans to remain in Nepal and hopes to help where he can.

“I definitely want to stick around and see if we can help out and see what else is going to happen here,” he said.

This is the first trip Pineo has taken outside of Canada.

France is ready to provide rescue assistance to Nepal after a major earthquake hit the country, said French president Francois Hollande Saturday.

In a press release of his presidential office the Elysee, Hollande expressed France's solidarity with the people and the government of Nepal after the earthquake in the Kathmandu area.

A 8.1-magnitude earthquake struck Nepal early Saturday morning, the China Earthquake Networks Center said.

The epicenter was monitored at 28.2 degrees north latitude and 84.7 degrees east longitude, and the focus of the quake is 20 km deep, according to the center.

More than 700 people were killed so far by the deadly earthquake, according to local authorities. Enditem

For many Iowans, the horrific images from Nepal may seem distant.

The county sandwiched between India and China is halfway around the world, a 24 hour flight, and 11 time zones away.

For Madan Thapa and Bikal Adhikari, the images hit close to home.

""The epicenter was in the village where I’m from. It had me worried about my parents who still live there,"" Adhikari said.

Both have been in Iowa for about a decade and are leaders in Des Moines' Nepalese community which consists of about 250 people.

Most of their immediate family members and closest friends are still in Nepal.

""My brother called me. I knew my brother and parents were together so I knew they were safe at that point,” Thapa told Channel 13 News.

Both have confirmed that loved ones are safe mostly through social media sites like Skype and Facebook.

However, thousands of neighbors have lost their lives and many of the city's historic buildings have been reduced to rubble.

“Dharahara is a tall structure. It's a landmark. When you say Kathmandu, you know Dharahara. That is completely gone,” Thapa said.

""All the structures and historical places that say this is Kathmandu are gone. We don't have Kathmandu anymore. We need to rebuild again,” Adhikari said.

From afar, both want to help do exactly that. Rebuild Kathmandu.

The Iowa Nepalese Association is meeting this weekend to discuss local fundraising efforts. Their fellow countrymen and women will be close to their hearts as plans come together.

""Every drop makes an ocean. Small help helps everybody at this point,” Adhikari said.

The Iowa Nepalese Association plans to post updates on their local efforts and how people can help on their website and Facebook page.

More than 1,800 people were killed by a powerful earthquake that struck Nepal on Saturday. The earthquake – which measured 7.8 on the Richter scale – wrecked houses, levelled centuries-old temples and triggered avalanches on Mount Everest. At least 18 people were killed on the mountain, and hundreds of tourists and guides are now trapped or buried in snow and ice there as rescue parties struggle to reach them.

One climber, Alex Gavan, tweeted that he had to run for his life after an avalanche struck Everest’s base camp and reported that many had died and many more were badly injured. He appealed for urgent help to save those hurt. Mohan Krishna Sapkota, a government official, also appealed for help for Nepal. “We are facing a tremendous crisis here and it is hard to even assess what the death toll and the extent of damage could be,” he said.

The tremor was the worst to hit the landlocked nation, sandwiched between India and China, in more than 80 years. At least 1,130 people were confirmed dead in Nepal, with others killed in north India, China and Bangladesh. Given the scale of the destruction, the death toll is almost certain to rise, said Laxmi Dhakal, a home ministry official.



Relief efforts were being hampered by a collapse in communications, raising fears that a widespread humanitarian disaster was unravelling across the impoverished Himalayan nation of 28 million. “This is a very large earthquake in a significantly populated region with infrastructure that has been damaged in past earthquakes,” said US Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle.

The Nepalese government made an urgent appeal for foreign help, with India sending in military aircraft with medical equipment and relief teams. The UK deployed an eight-strong team of humanitarian experts, including disaster response and search-and-rescue specialists. David Cameron had earlier tweeted that the UK would do everything it could to help.

The earthquake occurred a few minutes before noon and rumbled across the densely populated Kathmandu Valley, rippled through the capital and spread north towards the Himalayas and Tibet, and west towards the historic city of Lahore in Pakistan. A magnitude 6.6 aftershock struck an hour later and smaller aftershocks continued to jolt the region for hours.

Residents ran out of buildings in panic when the earthquake struck. Walls tumbled, large cracks opened on streets and walls, towers collapsed and clouds of dust began to swirl all around.

“Our village has been almost wiped out,” said Vim Tamang, a resident of Manglung, near the epicentre. “Most of our houses are either buried by landslide or damaged by shaking.” He said that half of the village’s population was missing or dead. “All the villagers have gathered in the open area. We don’t know what to do.”

Indian tourist Devyani Pant was in a Kathmandu coffee shop when “suddenly the tables started trembling and paintings on the wall fell to the ground. I screamed and rushed outside,” she told Reuters. Later she reported that she could see three bodies of monks who had been trapped in the debris of a collapsed building. “We are trying to pull the bodies out and look for anyone who is trapped,” she said.

At Bir Emergency Hospital, doctors were fighting to treat the wounded and save the lives of dozens of badly injured victims of the tremor. Gajendra Mani Shah, a doctor, said he was dealing mainly with head traumas and limb injuries from falling rubble. He said the hospital had treated about 400 patients so far and that at least 50 had died. People were lying in rows on mattresses, surrounded by bloodsoaked tissues, and lined the corridors, hooked up to intravenous drips.

Another doctor, Erabesh Gyawali, said he rushed to the hospital after the first tremor hit. He and his wife were riding their scooter when the earthquake struck and were thrown off, narrowly missing being hit by falling rubble.

Pushpa Das, a Kathmandu labourer, was injured when a wall collapsed on him as he ran from his house. “It was very scary. The earth was moving,” he told reporters as he waited for treatment outside one hospital. As he spoke, dozens more showed up with injuries, mostly from falling bricks. Kathmandu’s international airport was shut down.

A Swedish woman, Jenny Adhikari, who lives in Nepal, told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that she was riding a bus in the town of Melamchi, north-east of Kathmandu, when the earth began to move. “A huge stone crashed only about 20m from the bus,” she was quoted as saying. “All the houses around me have tumbled down. I think there are a lot of people who have died.”

Subarna Khadka was bathing when the first tremor happened, but couldn’t escape because the earthquake jammed his bathroom door. “I almost lost my hope of life. I was trapped. But my wife rescued me once the shaking got quiet. I could only pray to God for life.”

At the main hospital in Kathmandu, volunteers formed human chains to clear the way for ambulances to bring in the injured, while across the city, rescuers scrabbled through the rubble of destroyed buildings, among them ancient, wooden Hindu temples, in search of victims.

Thousands in Kathmandu were bedding down in the open air after Nepal’s national radio warned people to stay outdoors because of the danger that more aftershocks might occur. “Everyone is scared of a repeat,” said 29-year-old Rabin Shakya. “I rushed outside when I felt the earthquake. I was terrified. I’ve stayed outside all day.”

On one patch of ground in Kathmandu, three children huddled under a blanket. Ragan Karki, 16, said he and his siblings had come there to seek shelter for the night and were waiting for their parents to join them. They had been in their third-floor flat when the earthquake struck. Ragan’s 12-year-old brother, Ryan, added: “I was scared, but I didn’t cry.”

In the community of Nyakha Chowk, 1,500 residents assembled around a Buddhist temple for the night where dinner was being cooked in two giant pots. “Everyone has made a donation,” said Vidho Ratna.

While the scale of the disaster has yet to be ascertained, the earthquake is likely to put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country, best known for the highest mountain in the world and its rich Hindu culture. The economy of Nepal is heavily dependent on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.

Among the buildings destroyed by the earthquake was the Unesco-listed Dharahara Tower. The 60m tower was built in 1832 for the Queen of Nepal. Yesterday, all that remained of the lighthouse-like building was a jagged stump just 10m high. Sujata Thapa, 22, said he was passing Dharahara when the earthquake struck. “I stood still. In a few seconds, I saw Dharahara falling down. People were screaming.” The tower was a popular tourist destination and every weekend hundreds of people paid to go up to the viewing platform on its eighth storey. It is not yet clear how many tourists were on the tower when it collapsed, though reports indicate that several bodies were later extracted from the ruins.

The earthquake was also felt in India’s capital of New Delhi and several other Indian cities. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, called a meeting of top government officials to review the damage and how to respond in parts of India that felt strong tremors. The states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Sikkim, which share a border with Nepal, have reported building damage. Pakistan’s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, offered “all possible help” that Nepal may need.

Christian Aid announced it had made an initial £50,000 available to help victims of the earthquake and added that it would launch an appeal.

“The earthquake is the nightmare scenario which we have long discussed and wondered if we could make major improvements before a catastrophe occurred,” said Dr Ilan Kelman, of the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, at University College London.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The epicentre of the quake was 50 miles (80km) north-west of the capital and is the worst tremor in the Himalayan nation in over 80 years.

“Nepal has some of the world’s best people and initiatives for community-based seismic risk reduction and earthquake education. But the country has also suffered terrible conflicts, poor governance and heart-wrenching poverty, all of which created and perpetuated the vulnerability which has been devastatingly exposed during the shaking. The pictures and reports emerging do not bode well for other earthquake-prone cities with similar vulnerabilities.”

In Britain, fears were growing over the welfare of several nationals who have not been heard from since the quake struck. A spokeswoman for Intrepid, which arranges treks in Nepal and around the Everest region, said it was trying to get in touch with tour groups in the area that included Britons.

Google launched a 2015 Nepal Earthquake “person finder” database that listed several of those missing. They include Sebastian Lovera, a 22-year-old qualified skiing and diving instructor, from Tonbridge, Kent, whose last known location was Khumjung on Tuesday, from where he was heading towards Everest base camp.

His stepfather, Greg Smye-Rumsby, said: “Sebastian is an extremely lively and self-motivated person and that is why he went to Nepal. We haven’t heard from him. He would not have switched his phone off. We have tried ringing it. Sometimes it rings and sometimes we get an answer, but it’s an automated answer. It says the phone is switched off. He’s certainly not a person to take risks. He’s the absolute opposite.”

Lovera is described as being around 5ft 8in tall, with dark blond/light brown hair and very fit. He has a red Black Diamond down jacket and brown Karrimor walking boots with a hole in the left boot.

Another Briton feared missing is Laura Wood, 23, from Huddersfield, described by a friend as a “glowing, lovely, beautiful young girl”. She is said to have been trekking in the Himalayas without any means of making contact.

The UK’s international development secretary, Justine Greening, said: “My thoughts are with the people of Nepal, in particular all those who have lost loved ones. The absolute priority must be to reach people who are trapped and injured, and provide shelter and protection for those who have lost their homes.”

The Chinese government is preparing emergency relief materials and will send the supplies to quake-hit Nepal soon, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said late Saturday.

China International Search & Rescue Team (CISAR) will leave for Nepal Sunday morning to help with relief work in Nepal after the country was hit by a 8.1- magnitude earthquake earlier Saturday, Hong Lei said in a written statement.

More than 900 people, including 256 in the capital of Kathmandu, have been killed in the earthquake, which jolted large parts of Nepal as well as eastern India and Bangladesh on Saturday.

Some counties in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region was also affected by the strong earthquake.

China follows closely the developments of the earthquake in Nepal and conveys great concern and sympathy to the Nepalese people, said Hong.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and Foreign Minister Wang Yi have respectively sent messages of condolences to Nepalese President Ram Baran Yadav, Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mahendra Bahadur Pande, according to Hong.

In the messages, they expressed profound condolences to the deceased and deep sympathy to the bereaved families and the injured.

The Chinese government also extended solicitude to other countries affected by the earthquake, including India, Bangladesh and Bhutan, said Hong, adding that China is ready to provide assistance to these countries within its capacity.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese embassy in Nepal have launched emergency response mechanism to help with the Chinese nationals who have been injured in the disaster and deal with the aftermath of the deceased, adding that the Chinese diplomatic missions will also coordinate China's relief operations in Nepal.

Kathmandu – More than 1,500 people were killed by a powerful earthquake that struck Nepal on Saturday. The earthquake – which measured 7.8 on the Richter scale – wrecked houses, levelled centuries-old temples and triggered avalanches on Mount Everest. At least 18 people were killed on the mountain, and hundreds of tourists and guides are now trapped or buried in snow and ice there as rescue parties struggle to reach them.

Google launched a 2015 Nepal Earthquake “person finder” database that listed several of those missing.

Dharahara tower: Also known as the Bhimsen Tower, is a 9 storey tower which collapsed after the quake.. Built in 1832 A.D, the tower was built by the then Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, on the instruction of Queen Lalit Tripura Sundari.

The tremor was the worst to hit the landlocked nation, sandwiched between India and China, in more than 80 years. At least 1,130 people were confirmed dead in Nepal, with others killed in north India, China and Bangladesh. Given the scale of the destruction, the death toll is almost certain to rise, said Laxmi Dhakal, a home ministry official.

Relief efforts were being hampered by a collapse in communications, raising fears that a widespread humanitarian disaster was unravelling across the impoverished Himalayan nation of 28 million. “This is a very large earthquake in a significantly populated region with infrastructure that has been damaged in past earthquakes,” said US Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle.

The Nepalese government made an urgent appeal for foreign help, with India sending in military aircraft with medical equipment and relief teams.

More than 5,500 people are dead and some 11,440 have been reported injured four days after a massive 7.8-magnitude earthquake rocked Nepal. Tens of thousands Nepalis have weathered terrifying aftershocks for days, slept in the streets and hunkered down as teams worked to dig out survivors.

Helicopters brought food, temporary shelter and other aid to hamlets north of Kathmandu in the mountainous Gorkha District, which is near the epicenter of the massive earthquake. Homes were reduced to piles of stone and splintered wood, the Associated Press reported. Women greeted the delivery with repeated cries of ""We are hungry!""

As many as 250 people are missing following an avalanche Tuesday along a trekking route north of Kathmandu , Reuters reported. Bad weather is making the rescue efforts more difficult, Rasuwa District Governor Uddhav Bhattarai told Reuters.

According to prime minister Sushil Koirala, the earthquake's death toll could climb to 10,000 or higher when the recovery phase is completed, the Guardian reported.

And on the world's tallest mountain, dozens of avalanche survivors required rescue after the quake triggered a deadly slide that killed at least four Americans.

Geoff Pinnock of the U.N.'s World Food Program was leading a convoy of trucks north toward the worst affected areas when the rain began to pound, leaving them stuck.

""This rain has caused a landslide that has blocked my trucks. I can maybe get one truck through and take a risk driving on the dirt, but I think we'll have to hold the materials back to try to get them out tomorrow by helicopter,"" he said.

Aid workers who had reached the edges of the epicenter described entire villages reduced to rubble.

""In some villages, about 90 percent of the houses have collapsed. They're just flattened,"" said Rebecca McAteer, an American physician who rushed to the quake zone from the distant Nepal hospital where she works.

How You Can Help

After the earthquake struck, multiple organizations sent crews to the area, offering aid and much-needed supplies. Here are those involved and how you can help.

Most those injured, she added, were young people and the elderly, since most young men long ago left their villages in search of better-paying work.

""The immediate need is getting support to where it's needed, but there will be a lot of work rebuilding,"" said McAteer, who was heading back soon to the center of the quake zone.

Tragedy Aboard Everest

To the northeast of Kathmandu, the Mount Everest base camp has grown deeply quiet over the past couple days, as more and more climbers leave in the wake of the deadly avalanche that pulverized part of the mountaineering village after the Saturday earthquake.

Base camp is ""very silent,"" Azim Afif, the leader of a team from University of Technology Malaysia, said during a brief interview on the messenger service WhatsApp. His team, he said, had decided not to attempt to reach the summit. They were planning to descend from base camp Wednesday.

(PHOTOS: Devastating Earthquake Rocks Nepal )

The main trail through the Khumbu Icefall, the expanse of immense chunks of ice that must be traversed during summit attempts, was wiped out by the avalanche. The ""Icefall Doctors"" — the Sherpas who create the trail of ropes and ladders — had already left base camp, he said.

As a result, ""I'm not sure if anyone is still trying"" to make summit attempts, he added.

Health Hazards Widespread

Across central Nepal, including in Kathmandu, the capital, hundreds of thousands of people are still living in the open without clean water or sanitation. It rained heavily in the city Tuesday, forcing people to find shelter wherever they could.

At Kathmandu airport, flights arrived with emergency aid and helicopters brought in both foreign trekkers and local villagers from quake-struck areas. Helicopters chartered by trekking companies reached the Langtang area, about 40 miles north of Kathmandu, a popular area for trekking — a key contributor to the country's economy.

Dave Gordon, from San Francisco, California, said he was in the area until Tuesday waiting for the rescue flight.

""Cliffs came down, four or five porters were deceased, buried in the rock fall,"" he said of the quake. ""Trails are completely destroyed. People are stuck. They can't get out. It was very bad.""

The United Nations says it was releasing $15 million from its central emergency response fund for quake victims. The funds will allow international humanitarian groups to scale up operations and provide shelter, water, medical supplies and logistical services, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said.

Trucks carrying food were on their way to affected districts outside the hard-hit and densely-populated Kathmandu valley, and distribution of the food was expected to start Tuesday.

Citing government figures, Haq said an estimated 8 million people have been affected by the quake in 39 of Nepal's districts, and more than 1.4 million need food assistance, including 750,000 who live near the epicenter in poor quality housing.

The U.N. humanitarian country team for Nepal is coordinating international relief efforts with the government and a clearer picture of needs should emerge within the next 48 hours, he said. The immediate priority is search and rescue, and removing debris to find survivors still trapped, he said.

Many of the ornate, historic buildings in Bhaktapur, a key tourist site just east of Kathmandu, were reduced to rubble. Residents began returning to collect whatever belongings they could.

Rescue workers and medical teams from at least a dozen countries were helping police and army troops in Kathmandu and surrounding areas, said Maj. Gen. Binod Basnyat, a Nepal army spokesman. Contributions came from large countries like India and China — but also from Nepal's tiny Himalayan neighbor of Bhutan, which dispatched a medical team.

At the Kathmandu airport, foreign planes from India, the U.S., China, Malaysia, Pakistan, Israel that brought aid and rescue personnel lined up on the crowded tarmac.

Coming out of the airport with dry blood on his face and legs, Min Bahadur Raut said he got a ride on a helicopter from a neighbor who had chartered a flight for his mother. He has not been able to move his left arm.

""We haven't seen any government help or relief at our village"" northeast of Kathmandu, he said. Roads have been closed by landslides. ""I don't know what is wrong with me. I have no money,"" he said. ""I have been in pain for days now.""

""We do not yet know the scope of the damage, but this could be one of the deadliest and most devastating earthquakes since the 1934 tremor which devastated Nepal and Bihar,"" said Jagan Chapagain, Asia/Pacific director of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

The IFRC said it was extremely concerned about the fate of rural villages close to the epicentre of the quake, some 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the capital Kathmandu.

""Roads have been damaged or blocked by landslides and communication lines are down preventing us from reaching local Red Cross branches to get accurate information,"" said Chapagain in a statement.

""We anticipate that there will be considerable destruction and loss of life.""

Other aid organisations responding to the emergency also struggled to assess the needs with communications cut off around the Himalayan nation.

""Communication is currently very difficult. Telephone lines are down and the electricity has been cut off making charging mobile phones difficult,"" said Cecilia Keizer, Oxfam country director in Nepal.

""People are gathered in their thousands in open spaces and are scared as there have been several aftershocks,"" she added.

24-hr control room in MEA, Nepal thanks India for assistance

New Delhi, Apr 25, 2015 (PTI) 16:09 IST

In the wake of the devastating earthquake in Nepal, a control room has been set up in Ministry of External Affairs to provide all help and information round the clock.



The numbers to the 24-hour Control Room are +91 11 2301 2113, +91 11 2301 4104 and +91 11 2301 7905, an official statement said.



Minister of State for External Affairs V K Singh has expressed solidarity with Nepal, saying India stands by it in this hour of distress.



""Will be our endeavour to extend all support & assistance to those affected,"" he tweeted.

Ambassador-designate of Nepal here Deep Kumar Upadhyay said his country needs mobile medical assistant units from India, besides other help.



He thanked India for stepping in and offering help saying, ""We have been in touch with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh. Our President is in touch with them and they have offered to help us. I thank India on behalf of Nepal for assisting us"".



Meanwhile, India has kept its transport aircraft and C17 Globemaster, C-130 Hercules and helicopters on standby.

He thought it was a joke.

Lying down at his camp on one of the approaches to Mt. Everest, Dutch mountaineer Eric Arnold assumed that his friend was shaking the tent. A prank. But then the ground trembled.

“When I zip open my tent, I see avalanches coming down on three sides,” Arnold wrote later on his blog.

A cloud stirred by the racing debris rose and caught Arnold as he ran for cover.

“I am completely disoriented and run against Moulay's tent,” he wrote. His ears filled with snow.

The avalanche was unleashed by a powerful quake that struck about 150 miles away and killed at least 1,800 in several countries. It came a week after the first anniversary of a snow and ice fall that killed 16 Nepalese guides, one of the worst disasters in the modern history of climbing Everest.

In the avalanche that hit the base camp Saturday, 17 people were confirmed dead, according to Nepalese officials and climbers, and others are unaccounted for or stranded on the mountain.

One avalanche struck above base camp on the southern route to Mt. Everest. There were at least 1,200 people at the base camp Saturday, including cooks, porters and guides. It is the height of climbing season on the world's tallest mountain.

Reaching their social media accounts from some of the highest reaches on the planet — the base camp is at 17,500 feet — people blasted out almost immediate, gripping accounts of the confusion and fear that followed the fall of snow, ice and rock.

Among the climbers on the mountain Saturday was Bay Area resident Dan Fredinburg, a strapping thrill-seeker who wrote on his Linked-In profile that he led an “adventure team” for Google that embarked on expeditions to bring back “stunning imagery from the planet's most remote regions.”

He also led multiple expeditions to gather images of a region around Everest, for use on the “Street View” function of Google's maps.

Fredinburg, who had been in Nepal for about 20 days, chronicled his trek online, on Tuesday posting a photo of blue, green and yellow flags draped across helmets, poles and other equipment:

“We piled up our gear on the altar to have it blessed. Lama Dawa Rita, a Sherpa from our Gurka team, asks the Goddess Everest for permission for our team to step through the ice fall soon.”

The Khumbu Icefall is the forward edge of a glacier just above base camp.

On Friday, the day before the quake, Fredinburg posted a photo of himself drinking from a metal cup: “Ice training with @micbattelli means frequent stops for morning cappuccino, regardless of danger.”

That danger came about noon the next day.

Arnold's narrative, translated from Dutch, describes the chaotic scene after the avalanche swept down the mountain:

“There is barely any visibility. Tenzi falls into an ice lake, Arnold too. I step into a glacier crack. Finally we see people.

“It seems for a moment as if a body is being dragged, but fortunately the Sherpa only has a leg injury. We give him a strong pain killer and help him down. Three times I get very scared when there is an aftershock and avalanche. It's like being run over by a freight train. We huddle together but it's not that bad.

“We're told there are other climbers higher up on the mountain, we won't be able to reach them now.”

Arnold discovered that his camp, though enveloped by the cloud kicked up by the avalanche, escaped a direct hit. He and other climbers began to search for victims.

“I would want people to do the same for me,” he wrote.

They found devastation. Base camp, he said, looked like a refugee camp. The impact had strewn tents, personal belongings and climbing gear everywhere.

Many victims had head injuries, Arnold said. Some people fled in a panic, while others scrambled to get

gear for the cold night ahead.

“There may be about 10 to 30 fatalities,” Arnold wrote. “A Japanese man shows me horrid pictures on his phone that make me shudder.”

On the way back to his tent, Arnold checked the crumpled tents for sleeping bags and down packs that he could use in an emergency shelter, terrified that he would find a body.

“What a hell,” he wrote.

Posts on social media shared similar experiences, complete with photos of smashed yellow tents and gray disjointed poles stabbing into the air.

“Huge disaster,” mountaineer Alex Gavan tweeted. “Helped searched and rescued victims through huge debris area. Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap.”

Others posted online to let people know they weren't hurt.

“Walking back from camp 1 in EB,” tweeted Jelle Veyt. “A major earthquake occurred followed by a massive avalanche. Ran for my life.”

One woman took to Facebook to relay news from a climbing team unable to contact friends and family members.

“The Alpine Ascents International Mt. Everest climbing team was in the icefall and is now safe at Camp 1, avoiding the avalanche that hit Base Camp due to an earthquake in Nepal near Kathmandu,” she wrote. “I've tagged those I know ... in an effort to provide their family and friends with an update that the team is OK.”

On Saturday afternoon, Fredinburg's sister Megan turned to social media too.

“This is Dans little sister Megan,” she wrote on his

Instagram account. “I regret to inform all who loved him that during the avalanche on Everest early this morning our Dan suffered from a major head injury and didn't make it. We appreciate all of the love that has been sent our way thus far and know his soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us.”

Fredinburg's various social media accounts paint a portrait of a man at the height of life, in an interesting business, technology and the outdoors. The Linked-In profile lists previous occupations that included “IT Consultant” and “Software Engineer” as well as “Apprentice Carpenter” and “Farm Hand.”

One of his friends, Breton Carasso, said Fredinburg had been to Everest before.

“Never have I met a man with so much excitement for pushing his own limits and ideas,” he wrote on Instagram. “After almost getting caught in the tragic ice fall last year on Everest he decided to go back again this year and try once more.”

On Everest, it's unclear how many remain on the mountain, or when help might reach them. “I have no idea how I will get out of here,” Arnold wrote.

He also wondered about the toll yet to be discovered.

“I think much is hidden by the snow.”

The Canadian government has pledged $5 million to help Nepal recover from a powerful earthquake that has killed more than 1,800 people, the foreign affairs department says.

The magnitude 7.9 quake, Nepal’s worst in 81 years, sent tremors through northern India on Saturday and triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest.

The Canadian government said in a statement late Saturday it is sending its Disaster Assistance Response Assessment Team and officials are working to ensure Canadians in Nepal are OK.

“Our officials in the region are working with Nepalese and Indian authorities to ensure that any Canadians affected by the earthquake are safe and accounted for,” Harper said in a statement Saturday.

Foreign Affairs says it’s aware of 388 Canadians in Nepal, but spokeswoman Diana Khaddaj said that figure is only an estimate as registration is voluntary.

Kali Pokhrel -- Nepal’s ambassador to Canada -- described the earthquake as the worst natural disaster the country has seen in decades.

“This is something we have not experienced in our lifetime,” Pokhrel said, who added falling debris killed one of his relatives.

The earthquake destroyed to a number of heritage sites, including the Dharahara tower, which was built in 1832.

“It’s a great loss for Nepal and Nepal’s identity,” Pokhrel said.

We mourn w/ the people of Nepal & India in the aftermath of this terrible disaster & offer our help & our prayers. http://t.co/kJ1fZ4AScY — Stephen Harper (@pmharper) April 25, 2015

A World Vision Canada worker from Toronto attending a conference in Nepal found herself unexpectedly caught in the earthquake.

Reena Vohra, a World Vision child protection specialist, said she had “never experienced anything like this.”

She was visiting a town close to Kathmandu with colleagues when the ground began to shake and they ran for cover.

“Buildings were crumbling all around us,” Vohra said. “When it felt safe, we ran to an open space where we were able to see the devastation of the ancient pagodas and temples that we had literally just visited an hour before.”

As fears grew of a humanitarian disaster in the impoverished Himalayan nation of 28 million, the Nepalese government has appealed for foreign help.

Canadian charities have begun fundraising to deal with the aftermath.

World Vision Canada spokesman Bob Neufeld said their teams have hit the ground in Nepal and are “assessing the situation.”

“The most immediate needs are food and non-food supplies, such as potable water, shelter kits and basic household supplies,” he said.

Rahul Singh of GlobalMedic -- a Canadian disaster response charity -- said it too has sent a team from India to Nepal, with a team from Canada on its way over the weekend.

“It’s a very big earthquake,” Singh said. “We need the public support.”

Harper offered his condolences to the Nepalese and Indian people.

“We mourn with the people of Nepal and India in the aftermath of this terrible natural disaster and offer our help and our prayers.”

KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Tens of thousands of Nepalese who spent the night under a chilly sky were jolted awake by strong aftershocks Sunday, and rescuers aided by international teams cleared rubble in search of survivors after a powerful earthquake killed at least 1,865 people across the Himalayan region.

The death toll continued to climb as more reports came in from far-flung areas, with 1,805 in Nepal alone, said Home Ministry official Laxmi Dhakal.

The magnitude 7.8 earthquake, which originated outside the capital, Kathmandu, was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years. It was strong enough to be felt all across the northern part of neighboring India, Bangladesh, China’s region of Tibet and Pakistan, where a total of 60 people died.

“There were at least three big quakes at night and early morning. How can we feel safe? This is never-ending and everyone is scared and worried,” said Sundar Sah. “I hardly got much sleep. I was waking up every few hours and glad that I was alive.”

Residents fled homes and buildings in panic. Walls tumbled, trees swayed, power lines came crashing down and large cracks opened up on streets and walls. Clouds of dust began to swirl all around.

Most of the area were without power and water Sunday, but with Kathamandu airport reopened, first aid flights began delivering aid supplies. Workers were sending out tents and relief goods in trucks and helicopters, said disaster management official Rameshwar Dangal.

He said that government and private schools have been turned into shelters.

Within hours of the quake, hospitals had filled up with hundreds of injured people, and by Sunday, their numbers swelled to nearly 5,000. Many survivors were brought to hospitals by friends and relatives in motorized rickshaws, flatbed trucks and cars. Residents used their bare hands, crowbars and other tools to dig through rubble and rescue survivors.

More than two dozen aftershocks jolted the area after the first quake, which struck just before noon Saturday, and continued into Sunday. At the time, Shrish Vaidya, who runs an advertising agency, was in his two-story house outside Kathmandu with his parents.

“It is hard to describe. The house was shaking like crazy. We ran out and it seemed like the road was heaving up and down,” Vaidya, 46, told The Associated Press. “I don’t remember anything like this before. Even my parents can’t remember anything this bad.”

Once the first shaking stopped, Vaidya thought his family could return indoors by evening. But the jolts kept coming, and they felt safer outdoors.

“It’s cold and windy so we are all sitting in the car listening to the news on FM radio,” he said. “The experts are saying it’s still not safe to go back inside. No one can predict how big the next aftershock will be.”

So the family ate dinner outside with the headlights of their car providing light. Vaidya was grateful his wife and 10-year-old son were on holiday in the U.S.

In his largely affluent neighborhood of low-rise, sturdy homes in suburban Kathmandu the damage was relatively light. In other parts of the city where the buildings are older and poorly built people were not as lucky.

Forecasts called for rain and thunder showers Sunday and the temperatures were in the mid-50s (14 Celsius), cold enough to make camping outside uncomfortable.

Thousands of people spent the night at Tudikhel, a vast open ground in the middle of Kathmandu, just next to the old city that is lined with historic buildings and narrow lanes. Now it is in ruins.

“We hardly slept through the night. It was cold and it rained briefly and it was uncomfortable, but I am glad I brought my family out to the open,” said Ratna Singh, a vegetable vendor who was cuddled under a blanket with his wife and son.”

“At least I knew my family were safe. Every time the ground shook at night, I thanked god my family were there with me and safe. I don’t think I am going to be sleeping inside the house anytime soon. We are all petrified.”

People lay on plastic sheets or cardboard boxes, wrapped in blankets. Mothers kept their children warm; some lit fire with whatever wood they could find. Most were eating instant noodles and cookies.

Indian air force planes landed with 43 tons of relief material, including tents and food, and nearly 200 rescuers, India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said. The planes were returning to New Delhi with Indian nationals who were stranded in Kathmandu. More aid flights were planned for Sunday.

Hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overcrowded, running out of room for storing dead bodies and running out of emergency supplies, the United Nations said in a statement.

“The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise,” U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon said. “It is clear that very many lives have been lost. There has also been significant damage to Nepal’s irreplaceable cultural heritage.”

The quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world, and its rich Hindu culture. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, relies heavily on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.

A mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, said an avalanche after the quake swept base camp where expeditions were preparing to scale Everest, flattening tents and killing at least 10 climbers and guides and leaving an unknown number injured and missing and others cut off. Their nationalities were not immediately known.

Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, a Dane who was climbing the Everest with a Belgian, Jelle Veyt, said on his Facebook page that they were at Khumbu Icefall , a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow close to base camp at 5,000 meters (16,500 feet) when the earthquake hit.

“Right now, it is pretty chaotic and we try to help those injured,” Danish climber Carsten Lillelund Pedersen said on his Facebook page.

Norwegian climber Teodor Glomnes Johansen said that people at base camp were working on saving lives.

“All those who are unharmed organize help with the rescue efforts. Men, women and Sherpas are working side by side. The job right now is to assist the doctors in the camp here,” he told Norway’s VG newspaper.

The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the quake at 7.8. It said the quake hit at 11:56 a.m. local time (0611 GMT) at Lamjung, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu. Its depth was only 11 kilometers (7 miles), the largest shallow quake since the 8.2 temblor off the coast of Chile on April 1, 2014.

The shallower the quake the more destructive power it carries.

A magnitude 7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while an 8 magnitude quake can cause tremendous damage. This means Saturday’s quake - with the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 - was about 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.

The quake occurred at the boundary between the two pieces, or plates, of Earth’s crust, one of which supports India to the south and the other Eurasia to the north. The Indian plate is moving at 45 millimeters (1.7 inches) a year under the Eurasian plate, and this results in earthquakes once every 500 years on an average, said Marin Clark, a geophysicist at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

So the quake was “definitely not a surprise,” she said. Over millions of years, such quakes have led to the uplift of the Himalayas. Nepal suffered its worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.

The power of Saturday’s tremors brought down several buildings in the center of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers.

Among them was the nine-story Dharahara Tower, one of Kathmandu’s landmarks built by Nepal’s royal rulers as a watchtower in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognized historical monument. It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath.

Hundreds of people buy tickets on weekends to go up to the viewing platform on the eighth story, but it was not clear how many were up there when the tower collapsed. Video footage showed people digging through the rubble of the tower, looking for survivors.

The Kathmandu Valley is listed as a World Heritage site and is a collection of seven locations around Nepal’s capital that reflect the country’s rich religious history. The Buddhist stupas, public squares and Hindu temples are some of the most well-known sites in Kathmandu, and now some of the most deeply mourned.

The head of the U.N. cultural agency, Irina Bokova, said in a statement that UNESCO was ready to help Nepal rebuild from “extensive damage, including to historic monuments and buildings of the Kathmandu Valley.”

Nepali journalist and author Shiwani Neupane tweeted: “The sadness is sinking in. We have lost our temples, our history, the places we grew up.”

India is sending disaster-response teams, medical aid and food supplies to Nepal, which was hit by a powerful earthquake Saturday.

India’s foreign secretary, S. Jaishankar, said India would do “everything within its capability to be of help to Nepal in this difficult moment.”

Nearly 900 people have died, according to Nepalese police, who say the toll is likely to rise.

Mr. Jaishankar said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has made strengthening India’s relations with its neighbors one of his foreign policy priorities, has given Indian officials a “strong message to step forward.”

“Today’s Earthquake has made us all very sad,” a tweet from Mr. Modi’s official Twitter account said. “Nepal’s pain is our pain,” another tweet said.

Mr. Modi spoke to Nepal’s president, Ram Baran Yadav, and Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, assuring them of “support and assistance during this tough time,” Mr. Modi said in a tweet from his personal Twitter account.

Mr. Modi has made two visits to Nepal in his first year in office, one for talks with the Nepalese government and another for a summit of South Asian countries. The Indian premier is looking to bolster his country’s leadership role at a time when China has made deep in-roads into countries such as Nepal and Sri Lanka.

India’s Foreign Ministry said four air force planes – including a C-130 Super Hercules – were scheduled to touch down in Katmandu by the end of the day Saturday, carrying dozens of disaster-management personnel and a mobile hospital. Helicopters were also being prepared to help with rescue efforts and the distribution of food, the Foreign Ministry said.

Mr. Jaishankar said more aircraft would fly to Nepal in the coming days carrying ready-to-eat meals, specialized engineering teams, tents and blankets. India will also be working to bring Indian nationals home from Nepal, he said.

Kathmandu, Nepal

Yog Guru Baba Ramdev who is in Nepal today in talk to news agency ANI said he will serve quake-hit Nepal till last breath.

Ramdev said his volunteers donated blood and his organization is offering food, drinking water, toilet and halt facility in his Yoga shibir tent.

Ramdev said even after he leaves, Acharya Balkrishna will continue to stay in Nepal to offer services.

Ramdev also said that his Patanjali Sevashram will adopt orphan kids whose parents are dead in this earthquake.

Ramdev said his organization has reach in 14 administrative zones and 75 districts of Nepal through 30,000 volunteers.

Ramdev was in Nepal before earthquake took place. His Yoga camp session concluded just before the earthquake. He said it was narrow escape for him and the participants of Yoga camp, as entire tent fell down soon after the camp concluded its session. He said he also saw a building and trees collapsing outside the tent just after his Yoga session was over.

Yesterday evening when Government of India started evacuation operation, it first approached Baba Ramdev and asked him whether he would like to board a flight. Baba Ramdev refused to come back to India and conveyed that he would like to continue to stay in Nepal.

In another development, Shri Morari Bapu has offered donation of Rs. 51 lakh to Prime Minister’s relief fund. Prime Minister himself tweeted this yesterday.

A powerful earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale struck an area between Nepal's capital Kathmandu and the city of Pokhara at 11:41am local time on Saturday 25 April. A strong aftershock on Sunday caused further panic and frustrated efforts to reach survivors.

Death toll rising rapidly

Nepal home ministry officials now say over 2,500 people were killed and more than 5,000 were injured. These numbers are expected to rise again.

HelpAge South Asia Regional Director in Nepal, Peter McGeachie said:

""We have serious concerns for the areas in between the two cities. No information is available from them at the moment.

""We are in contact with UN and local authorities to carry out an urgent assessment of the situation and plan our response.""

Huge numbers affected

The government has reported that a total of 30 districts have been affected in the Western and Central Regions, including Kathmandu Valley districts.

2.5 million people live in densley populated Kathmandu Valley, many in buildings not fit to withstand a significant seismic event. 6.6 million live within the affected areas.

It is reported that private and government hospitals have run out of space and are treating patients outside.

Tent cities have sprung up for those displaced by the earthquake in Nepal. Many people lost their homes and those that didn't are afraid to go back to them because of the aftershocks.

Hundreds of thousands of people in central Nepal will be spending a second night outdoors.

Older people among most vulnerable

Around 9% of Nepal's population of 27 million is 60 or over. There is strong evidence that older persons suffer disproportionately from disasters even in developed countries.

In 2005, 75% of those killed by Hurricane Katrina were over 60 but made up just 15% of the population in New Orleans. In 2011, 56% of those who died in the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami were 65 and over, despite comprising just 23% of the population.

Nepal ranks at number 30 in HelpAge's Disaster Risk and Age Index, which assesses the the disaster risk faced by older people in 190 countries.

""Older people bear the initial brunt of disasters often because they cannot flee,"" said HelpAge International's Chief Executive, Toby Porter.

""This is compounded by the lack of essential medications for older people, such as those to treat diabetes, being available after disasters. And the mental fall-out from disasters is huge. Older women and men are ready to help others but are often too proud to help themselves.""

Challenges lie ahead

Aftershocks are expected to continue for some time, causing further damage and debilitating an already weak infrastructure.

Limited access to affected areas is expected to hamper search and rescue efforts. Clearing the debris could take weeks.

Rain is predicted throughout the next three days and people

will need shelter.

Rapid response

The HelpAge network has extensive experience of responding quickly to the needs of older people in the region.

HelpAge India has a disaster response model that is equipped to rush in quickly to reach out, not only to older people, but also to the wider community. At times of large scale disasters this model provides rapid relief in the form of food, clothing and shelter.

New Delhi: Yoga guru Ramdev, who is in Kathmandu for a yoga camp, is safe, his spokesperson said after a massive earthquake shook Nepal and parts of India on Saturday morning, causing widespread devastation.

Ramdev has gone there to conduct a five-day session being organised by Patanjali, Nepal chapter.

“Our sessions were from 5 am to 7.30 am. He then went to a different camp and at the time of the earthquake he was coming out from that session,” Ramdev’s spokesperson SK Tijarawala said.

“Also a few minutes after he came out of the ‘pandal’, it collapsed. And when he moved further away, he saw a multi-storey building collapse in front of his eyes,” he added.

Tijarawala also said: “He (Ramdev) has seen such natural disaster for the first time and was not in a position to understand what action he should take in the first place.”

According to Tijarawala, Ramdev is fine and has expressed grief and shock at this natural calamity. “He has assured Nepal that India will be by their side.”

“We have already mobilised thousands of our supporters to be active in rescue operations and other ground work required during this time of grief,” he added.

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj tweeted: “We have contacted Baba Ramdev in Kathmandu. He wishes to be there in this hour of crisis.”

Ramdev has postponed the inauguration of the first Patanjali Ayurved College and Hospital, and the laying of the foundation stone of the first Acharyakulam, a school based on vedic-cum-modern education, in Nepal.

Israel will send a rescue team to Nepal in the wake of the massive earthquake, a military statement said.

The mission is expected to leave Saturday night at the instruction of Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot, according to the military statement.

""Israel Defense Force will send an advance team in order to determine the extent of the IDF assistance required in Nepal,"" the statement read.

Director General of the Foreign Ministry Nissim Ben Shitrit said in a special press conference on Saturday afternoon that some 200 Israelis were out of contact since the 7.9-magnitude tremor hit some 80.5 km (50 miles) north-west of Kathmandu.

Overall, some 2,000 Israelis are currently in Nepal but no casualties were reported among them, Bet Shitrit added.

At least 1,400 people were reported dead across Nepal, making it the worst earthquake the poverty-stricken nation saw over the past 80 years. Endit

Dozens of Israelis and their newborn surrogate-born children were trapped in Nepal’s capital Kathmandu without shelter or medical care Saturday after the catastrophic earthquake that shook the Himalayan country.

As night fell, the Israeli government weighed airlifting the children and their parents to hospitals in India for treatment because of their condition.

The couples, along with 24 babies — nine of which were prematurely born — were trapped in Kathmandu, Ynet reported. One of the infants was in serious condition.

Many of the parents and their children were brought to the courtyard of the Israeli Embassy in Kathmandu, Channel 2 reported. Hundreds more Israeli travelers found shelter at the Chabad House in Kathmandu.

“Some of the babies are premature and in not such a good state of health and therefore it’s at the top of our priorities,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon told Channel 2. “We’re considering sending a helicopter from India to Kathmandu and that way we can take the whole group and bring the children to a hospital as soon as possible for them to receive proper treatment.”

Commercial flights to and from Kathmandu were terminated earlier Saturday after the international airport shut due to the earthquake. Israel plans to dispatch a search and rescue unit to Kathmandu and set up a field hospital, and to fly Israelis in Nepal back home, but rescue operations are on hold until the international airport reopens.

The Foreign Ministry said that there were no known Israeli deaths from the catastrophic earthquake, whose death toll continued to climb Saturday, with nearly 1,200 already pronounced dead after night fell. Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman said that there were a number of Israelis who suffered minor injuries, but no severe cases.

One of the Israeli parents took to Facebook to plead for help after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck the capital.

“We’re saved, but we need help,” Alon Michaeli Molian wrote on Facebook. “We’re still out in the open, 10 Israeli families with children and newborn babies. We can’t return to our rooms and apartments in the hotel out of fear of [its] collapse. I know that efforts are being made but I have no idea how we’ll survive this night.”

Interior Minister Gilad Erdan okayed a move to let the children come to Israel with their parents and delay the bureaucratic formalities until after their arrival in the country.

Nepalese officials said at least 1,170 people are known to have died in Nepal, making it the quake-prone Himalayan nation’s worst disaster in more than 80 years.

But the final toll from the 7.8 magnitude quake could be much higher, and dozens more people were reported killed in neighboring India and China.

“The death toll has reached 1,170,” Nepal police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam told AFP, adding that rescue efforts were still underway.

Emergency workers fanned out across the Himalayan nation to rescue those trapped under collapsed homes, buildings and other debris.

Offers of help poured in from governments around the world, with the United States and the European Union announcing they were sending in disaster response teams.

“Deaths have been reported from all regions except the far west. All our security personnel have been deployed to rescue and assist those in need,” Bam told AFP.

The Red Cross (IFRC) said it was concerned about the fate of rural villages close to the epicenter of the quake northwest of the capital Kathmandu.

“Roads have been damaged or blocked by landslides and communication lines are down preventing us from reaching local Red Cross branches to get accurate information,” said IFRC Asia/Pacific director Jagan Chapagain in a statement.

Officials said 10 people were killed when an avalanche buried parts of Mount Everest’s base camp in Nepal where hundreds of mountaineers have gathered at the start of the annual climbing season.

“We don’t have the details yet, but 10 have been reported dead so far, including foreign climbers,” Gyanendra Kumar Shrestha, an official in Nepal’s tourism department, told AFP.

“We are trying to assess how many are injured. There might be over 1,000 people there right now, including foreign climbers and Nepalese supporting staff.”

AFP Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly, on an assignment to Everest together with a colleague, was among those caught up in the chaos.

“We are both ok… snowing here so no choppers coming,” she said in an SMS on an approach to base camp. “I hurt my hand – got it bandaged and told to keep it upright to stop the bleeding.”

Experienced mountaineers said panic erupted at base camp which had been “severely damaged”, while one described the avalanche as “huge”.

“Huge disaster. Helped searched and rescued victims through huge debris area. Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap,” tweeted Romanian climber Alex Gavan from base camp.

The death toll quickly climbed to more than 1,400 Saturday in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Nepal that left much of the country's capital city of Kathmandu in ruins, caused avalanches on Mt. Everest 100 miles away and shook people and structures as far away as India, Tibet and Bangladesh.

The 7.8 magnitude quake struck about 50 miles outside Kathmandu Saturday, and by late Saturday, the death toll from the quake had topped 1,400, with heavy damage to the historic center of Kathmandu where buildings collapsed and crushed countless people inside them.

Another 34 people died in India, according to officials there.

The historic Dharahara tower, which had been a landmark of Kathmandu since it was built in 1832, collapsed during Saturday's earthquake, trapping an estimated 200 people under the rubble.

The avalanches triggered on the world's highest mountain by the high-powered quake killed eight people and injured many more. Nepalese tourism board officials said portions of the base camp used by hundreds of climbers to ascend Mount Everest were covered by the avalanche and the toll could include climbers and their guides, known as Sherpas.

While accounts could not be verified, friends and family of climbers on the mountain took to Twitter to seek information and support.

""Please. Anyone who is awake, please pray for my little brother Zachary who is on Mt Everest, I'd appreciate every prayer you have spare,"" tweeted Hugh Sheridan, an Australian actor and television personality.

Late Saturday, Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement of grief for Nepal over the tragedy, and said the U.S. was dispatching assistance.

""We are working closely with the government of Nepal to provide assistance and support. [U.S. Ambassador to Nepal Peter] Bodde has issued a disaster declaration in order to immediately release an initial $1 million for humanitarian assistance. USAID is preparing to deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team and is activating an Urban Search and Rescue Team to accompany disaster experts and assist with assessments of the situation,"" Kerry said.

On Saturday Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu also said his country would send a search and rescue team, and follow up with another plane to evacuate Israelis who were living or vacationing there.

Israel plans to send two planes to Nepal on Sunday to rescue Israelis caught in the massive earthquake that rocked the country and offer medical assistance to the Nepalese.



On Saturday night, an IAF plane with a team of experts flew to Nepal to assess the situation.





Based on the information they provide, Israel on Sunday will send one plane with a Magen David Adom team and another with a joint IDF and Foreign Ministry mission, as well as a field hospital.Those Israelis wanting to leave Nepal will be able to return on those planes. Among those expected to be rescued are 26 babies born to surrogate Nepalese women and their Israeli parents. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a message to his Nepalese counterpart Sushil Koirala.“Israel feels the pain of the disaster that struck your country. The state of Israel will make available emergency, rescue and medical assistance. The first such team left already tonight. We will help look for those and treat the wounded. On behalf of the citizens of Israel, I send our condolences to the families of the victims and wish a speedy recovery to the wounded. The state of Israel and its citizens stands by your side in this moment,” Netanyahu said.President Reuven Rivlin said, “Our thoughts and hearts go out to the people of Nepal dealing with this awful disaster, and with our loved ones who are in distress. The State of Israel is reaching out to help the search and rescue of the many victims.”As of press time, some 250 Israelis were unaccounted for. Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said the absence of phone service in the aftermath of the quake made it difficult to locate Israelis known to be in the country and cautioned against assuming that those unaccounted for were in danger.The Foreign Ministry has opened a hotline – 02-5303155 – for those looking for friends and relatives. In addition, a public page was created privately on Facebook where people have posted pictures of Israelis who have yet to be located.Netanyahu on Saturday held telephone consultations with Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman and Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon.Liberman also spoke with the Embassy of Israel in Nepal, whose staff and those Israelis who made it there have been advised to stay outdoors due to ongoing fears of aftershocks.On Saturday night, about 170 Israelis were camped out in tents in the embassy’s garden – some strumming guitars and others cooking lentils, according to Yehonathan Lebel, deputy chief of mission at the embassy.“We are all a bit shaken here,” he told The Jerusalem Post over the phone from a car where he was charging his cell phone. “We went out and we started offering the Israelis the option to come to the embassy because there is still a warning about aftershocks,” Lebel continued. “I have no intention of going to my apartment to sleep tonight.”As soon as the earthquake struck, just before noon, Lebel and his colleagues rushed to the embassy to open a situation room in cooperation with a parallel office in Jerusalem. While the embassy does not have exact numbers of how many Israelis are in the country, Lebel said there are likely several hundred – fewer than last season – as a result of October’s tragic avalanche.Regarding the number of Israelis potentially missing, Lebel explained that it is still impossible to present a clear figure, due to the fact that during the September-October and March- April hiking seasons many people simply set out trekking without means to contact them. The inability to contact trekkers on long hikes, unfortunately, is normal and, therefore, makes missing persons estimates irrelevant, he added.Nevertheless, Lebel said the number of Israelis in Nepal has been boosted by the approximately 26 surrogate babies recently born to Israeli parents. Of the babies, about 17 were spending Saturday night with their parents in the embassy garden and remained the first priority of the embassy officials, he said.“We are working with the ministry in Jerusalem hopefully to bring them back to Israel as soon as possible,” he said.Most of central Kathmandu and its main tourist area – Thamel – remained relatively intact, although some buildings did collapse, Lebel explained. “When you go a little bit outside [the center], you see more neighborhoods that have been affected.”Conditions were also relatively stable in Pokhara, a western district of Nepal popular among Israeli trekkers, Lebel continued.“That being said, there might be Israelis who went on treks and were caught in avalanches, but we don’t have any concrete information,” he said.“Today was a bit of a mess. This differs greatly from what happened in October because it was a focused, local event,” Lebel added. “It’s much harder to get the army or police on the phone.”At about 11:15 p.m. local time, Chabad Rabbi Chezki Lifshitz and his wife Chani posted on Facebook about the day’s events, writing that “at the hour of 11:55 a.m., the earth in Kathmandu trembled.”“For a long time, Nepal was shaken violently and for more long hours there was no quiet,” they wrote. “We are still experiencing aftershocks here. The wounds are still open, the sights here are severe and there are many, many casualties.”Hundreds of Israelis had gathered at the Chabad House in the morning, and the rabbi and his wife said they are taking part in the effort to locate missing Israelis in Nepal – in Pokhara, in the villages and the mountains. Satellite instruments the Chabad House distributes among mountain climbers have helped them maintain a connection with many of the trekkers out in the mountains, the Lifshitzes wrote.“Most of our efforts are now concentrated on managing lists of Israelis who have lost contact,” they said. “We also invited our frightened Nepalese neighbors who have lost their homes to come eat with us and families in need of lodging are also welcome into the compound.”Back at the Israeli Embassy garden, officials provided the campers with a power cord to charge their phones, bags of lentils, pots and water, as they settled in for the night. By Sunday, people should be able to return indoors and commercial airports are expected to open at which time Israeli teams from the New Delhi and Bangkok embassies are also expected to arrive, Lebel said.“There’s kind of a feeling of a commune a little bit,” Lebel added. “People have gone through a very long and stressful day.

Relief material is loaded into an Indian Air Force aircraft headed to Nepal, in New Delhi, India, Saturday, April 25, 2015. A powerful earthquake struck Nepal Saturday and collapsed houses, leveled centuries-old temples and triggered avalanches on Mt. Everest. It was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years.

World leaders and global charities offered condolences and emergency aid to Nepal following the earthquake Saturday while grappling to understand the scope of a disaster that left more than 1,300 dead.

With Internet and cellphone communications spotty, and many roads closed due to damage, the outside world did not yet have a clear picture of what is most needed following the devastating quake.

But it was clear that help was needed — and fast.

""We know the damage is extensive and that access into rural areas will be very, very difficult for everybody,"" said Ben Pickering, Save the Children's humanitarian adviser in Britain.

""Children will be affected in many ways. Physical injuries. Separated from families,"" he said. ""The priority now is understanding the scale, what the emergency needs are right now and in the coming weeks.""

Charities assembled disaster teams based on the assumption that sanitation, shelter and medical help are urgently required but the most convenient pathway into Nepal — one of the world's poorest countries — was not available because the international airport in Kathmandu was shut down.

Doctors Without Borders said four teams would leave Sunday morning for Nepal from Bihar state in India, close to the Nepal border. The organization is also sending in 3,000 kits including medical supplies.

AmeriCares has also sent a team from India and is preparing shipments of medical aid and relief supplies. ""We are prepared to help any way that we can,"" said AmeriCares President and CEO Michael J. Nyenhuis. ""This is a terrible tragedy and our hearts go out to the families suffering.""

Handicap International, which was already established in Nepal with 47 workers, was also offering assistance.

""One of our projects there, because it's earthquake-prone, is to help hospital staffs, physical therapists and others to anticipate the kind of injury we tend to see after a quake,"" said spokeswoman Mica Bevington. ""And we're sharing our resources, like all our wheelchairs are going to two hospitals in need.""

French aid group Doctors of the World (Medecins du monde) said it has mobilized its workers in Nepal — based in Kathmandu and Chautara to work on maternal and infant health — to help quake victims. It is sending more staffers and medical aid to the region immediately.

Mercy Corps, based in the United States, was checking on the safety of the large team it already had on the ground in Nepal and assessing the conditions there.

""As we better understand the needs on the ground, we will respond as appropriately,"" said CEO Neal Keny-Guyer said.

Countries around the globe pledged aid while Pope Francis offered his prayers for the victims and those working to save them.

""His Holiness commends the souls of the victims to the loving mercy of the Almighty and he offers encouragement to the civil authorities and emergency personnel as they continue their rescue efforts and assistance to those touched by this tragedy,"" Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said in a statement.

The European Union is considering ""some budget support"" to Nepal, according to a joint statement by the EU's foreign policy chief, development chief and humanitarian chief. It did not provide details or amounts.

""The full extent of the casualties and damage is still unknown but reports indicate they will likely be high, both in terms of loss of life, injuries and damage to cultural heritage,"" they said.

British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders also promised help for Nepal. Cameron said on Twitter that Britain ""will do all we can to help those caught up in it.""

The U.S. Embassy in Nepal announced $1 million in initial aid and the U.S. Agency for International Development activated an urban search and rescue team. The U.S. State Department also set up an email address and phone number for anyone who knows of U.S. citizens needing assistance in Nepal.

""We are working closely with the government of Nepal to provide assistance and support,"" said Secretary of State John Kerry. ""To the people in Nepal and the region affected by this tragedy we send our heartfelt sympathies. The United States stands with you during this difficult time.""

Norwegian Foreign Minister Boerge Brende said the Scandinavian country would allocate 30 million kroner ($3.8 million) to aid work, and that the money would be sent through the United Nations and charitable organizations.

""We are following the situation closely and we will find out whether to contribute further when we know more,"" Brende said in a statement.

Italy's Foreign Ministry said it has made available 300,000 euros ($326,000) of emergency aid for earthquake victims. The aid will be channeled through the International Red Cross.

French President Francois Hollande said France is ""ready to respond to requests for help and assistance"" from Nepalese authorities. The tiny, wealthy country of Monaco said it would send emergency aid ""in the coming hours.""

Among other countries sending condolences was Mexico, which suffered an 8.1-magnitude earthquake that killed an estimated 9,500 people in the nation's capital in 1985. Mexico's foreign ministry said it stood in solidarity with the government of Nepal and the relatives of the earthquake victims.

In New York, Uma Mysorekar, president of the Hindu Temple Society of North America, said the disaster requires ""global assistance.""

KATHMANDU - Hundreds of people were feared killed in Nepal Saturday after a massive 7.9 magnitude earthquake ripped through large parts of the country, toppling office blocks and towers in the panic-stricken capital Kathmandu.

RELATED STORIES

Officials said that at least 114 people are known to have died in Nepal but that the toll could be many times higher, while casualties were also reported in neighbouring India and Bangladesh.

There were also reports of an avalanche at Mount Everest's base camp in Nepal where scores of mountaineers have gathered at the start of the annual climbing season.

""In Kathmandu 71 have been reported dead so far,"" home ministry spokesman Laxmi Prasad Dhakal told AFP as the scale of the disaster began to emerge. Another 43 had been reported dead in the nearby Bhaktapur district, he added.

At least a dozen bodies were taken away from the ruins of Kathmandu's landmark Dharahara tower, according to an AFP photographer who saw similar scenes of multiple casualties in other parts of the city.

While contact with Nepal was sporadic, a senior Nepalese diplomat warned that the final toll could run into many hundreds.

""We have received reports that there is a big loss of property and life in Nepal,"" Krishna Prasad Dhakal, the deputy chief of mission at Nepal's Embassy in New Delhi, told AFP.

""Possibly hundreds of people have died in various parts of the country, particularly in Kathmandu and Pokhara.""

At least three people were known to have died in northern India while buildings in the capital New Delhi had to be evacuated.

The United States Geological Survey and India's meteorogical service said the shallow quake struck 81 kilometres northwest of Kathmandu at 0611 GMT (2.11am Singapore time), with walls crumbling and families racing outside their homes.

""The walls of houses have collapsed around me onto the road. All the families are outside in their yards huddled together,"" an AFP reporter said in Kathmandu.

Another resident recounted scenes of panic and mayhem.

""Everything started shaking. Everything fell down. The walls around the main road have collapsed. The national stadium's gates have collapsed,"" Anupa Shrestha said.

Police confirmed that the damage had been extensive.

""Our focus is on rescue in the core areas of Kathmandu where the population is concentrated,"" said metropolitan police spokesman Dinesh Acharya.

""Many houses and buildings have collapsed,"" he told AFP.

The quake tore through the middle of highways in the capital and also caused damage to the country's only international airport, in a potential blow to relief efforts.

The airport's general manager, Birendra Prasad Shrestha, said it would remain closed ""for safety reasons"" at least until later in the afternoon.

Kari Cuelenaere, an official at the Dutch embassy, said that the impact had swept the water out of a swimming pool at a Kathmandu hotel where Dutch national was being celebrated.

Hundreds die in Nepal quake

Powerful aftershocks have rocked Nepal, panicking survivors of a quake that killed more than 2350 and triggering fresh avalanches at Everest base camp, as rescuers dug through rubble in the devastated capital Kathmandu.

Terrified residents, many forced to camp out after Saturday’s quake reduced buildings to rubble, were jolted by this afternoon’s 6.7-magnitude aftershock that compounded the worst disaster to hit the impoverished Himalayan nation in more than 80 years.

interior Ministry spokesman Laxmi Dhakal says a total of 2352 people are confirmed dead across the country and 5838 people have been injured.

Officials in India said the toll there now stood at 60, while Chinese state media said 17 people had been killed in the Tibet region.

With scores of people still missing or seriously injured, the death toll is expected to climb further.

Hospitals were so stretched that medics had to set up tents outside to treat patients.

The historic nine-storey Dharahara tower, a major tourist attraction, was among the buildings brought down, with at least a dozen bodies recovered from the ruins of the 19th-century tower.

Offers of help poured in from around the world, with the United States and European Union announcing they were sending in disaster response teams and Australia giving $5 million in assistance, half of which will go to Australian non-government organisations .

India flew out its stranded citizens in military planes while a 62-strong Chinese rescue team arrived with sniffer dogs.

National police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam said the number known to have died in Nepal had risen to 1953 while 4629 people had been injured.

Officials in India said the toll there now stood at 53, mainly in the eastern state of Bihar, while Chinese state media said 17 people had been killed in the Tibet region.

Officials said 17 people were so far known to have died on Mount Everest where an avalanche triggered by the earthquake buried part of base camp.

It is the deadliest disaster in Everest’s history and comes almost exactly a year after an avalanche killed 16 sherpa guides.

AFP’s Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly, on an assignment at base camp, reported that six helicopters had managed to reach the mountain today after the weather improved overnight.

A stunning image captured by the agency’s South Asia photo chief Roberto Schmidt showed a massive cloud of snow and debris cascading onto base camp, burying scores of climbers and flattening tents.

“People being stretchered out as choppers land — half a dozen this morning,” Kannampilly said in a text message.

“Weather clear, some snowfall.” The country’s cellphone network was working only sporadically, while large parts of the capital were without electricity.

AFP correspondents in Kathmandu reported that tremors were felt throughout the night.

“It has been a sleepless night, how can we sleep? It has been shaking all night. We are just praying that this will end and we can return home,” said Nina Shrestha, a 34-year-old banker who spent the night with hundreds of people on open ground in the capital’s Tudhikhel district.

As rescuers sifted through the huge mounds of rubble, the hospitals were overflowing with victims who suffered multiple fractures and trauma.

“We have treated many people since yesterday, majority children,” said Samir Acharya, a doctor at Nepal’s Annapurna Neurological Hospital.

“Most patients have head injuries or fractures. Two of our patients died, two are critical.” Acharya said medics were working out of a tent set up in a parking lot because of overflowing patients, while some patients were too scared to stay in the building.

Rescue team personnel carry an injured person towards a waiting rescue helicopter at Everest Base Camp today.

Families had grabbed whatever possessions they could muster and sought shelter on the streets, many of which had been split asunder.

Weather forecasters warned that rain was on the way, with dark clouds looming over Kathmandu and promising more misery for displaced survivors.

Snowfalls on Saturday had thwarted efforts to airlift survivors from Everest, where around 800 mountaineers were gathered at the start of the annual climbing season, cancelled last year after the sherpa deaths.

Google executive Dan Fredinburg was one of the climbers to have been confirmed as having been killed.

Experienced mountaineers said panic erupted at base camp, which has been “severely damaged”, while one described the avalanche as “huge”.

“Seventeen have been reported dead so far and 61 are injured,” said Tulsi Gautam of Nepal’s tourism department which issues permits to climb the world’s highest mountain.

“Those who are able are walking down. Others are being airlifted.”

Kannampilly said many of those stranded at the scene were walking down the mountain rather than risk being stuck for days.

George Foulsham, a Singapore-based marine biologist, described the moment that the disaster struck.

“I was outside, saw a white 50-storey building of white come at me. I ran and it just flattened me,” he told AFP.

“I tried to get up and it flattened me again. I couldn’t breathe, I thought I was dead. When I finally stood up, I couldn’t believe it passed me over and I was almost untouched.

“I saved for years to climb Everest. It feels like the mountain is saying it’s not meant to be climbed for now. Too much of a coincidence to see this twice in two years.” Nepal and the rest of the Himalayas are particularly prone to earthquakes because of the collision of the Indian and Eurasia plates.

An 6.8 magnitude quake hit eastern Nepal in August 1988 killing 721 people, and a magnitude 8.1 quake killed 10,700 people in Nepal and India in 1934.

Aussies safe

More than 200 Australians in Nepal are confirmed safe after the massive earthquake.

However, authorities are still trying to contact hundreds of others, with 549 Australians registered as travelling in Nepal. Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop says officials are working under challenging conditions to locate all those in the country.

The federal government has committed $5 million in assistance, half of which will go to Australian non-government organisations.

An Australian Crisis Response Team will travel to Nepal as soon as possible to assist in establishing the welfare of the Australians still unaccounted for after Saturday’s 7.8 magnitude earthquake.

“While there are reports of extensive loss of life, at this point there are no reports of Australian deaths,” Ms Bishop said in a statement on Sunday.

Worried relatives have inundated social media with pleas for help and information.

Twitter and Facebook pages are showing images of Australians in Nepal while many families have reported dozens of loved ones missing on The Red Cross’s Family Links website.

One is 24-year-old Sydney business owner Matthew Graves, who was travelling through Pokhara.

His brother, Mitch Graves, is at home in Sydney waiting for news while their parents are overseas in America.

“It’s a bit of a struggle trying to communicate to everyone. It is a waiting game at the moment,” he told AAP.

The younger brother of Australian actor Hugh Sheridan is also missing.

“Please. Anyone who is awake, please pray for my little brother Zachary who is on Mt Everest,” Mr Sheridan tweeted.

Deb Williams is still waiting for news about her Brisbane-based son Jai, who was due to be at Mount Everest base camp on Saturday. Mr Williams was trekking with his friend Ben Flanders.

After being reported as missing, Perth woman Ballantyne Paige Forder has been found safe. The 22-year-old contacted her family today after helping move the orphanage where she worked to a field.

Amanda-Sue Markham tweeted: “My baby sister is safe. Prayers answered as she and the orphanage moved to safety”.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has opened its emergency call unit and updated travel advice for Nepal, warning of disruptions to communication, transport and tourist infrastructure in the country.

Australians concerned for family and friends are asked to try to contact them directly before calling DFAT’s 24-hour consular emergency centre on (02) 6261-3305 or, within Australia, 1300 555 135.

Aid agencies are already sending teams to Nepal to help in the aftermath of the country’s deadliest earthquake in more than 80 years.

Oxfam Australia chief executive Helen Szoke says a group of disaster specialists from the UK is flying in with supplies. “People are gathered in their thousands in open spaces and are scared,” Dr Szoke said in a statement.

The head of World Vision Australia Tim Costello is flying to Nepal to assess the recovery effort.

He says there are already 200 Nepalese World Vision staff on the ground and its relief experts are being flown in from Bangladesh and India.

He called on governments to mobilise and collaborate in the relief effort.

Anxious wait for families of Australians

By 10am on Sunday, worried relatives and friends had listed 66 names on The Red Cross’s Family Links website.

Since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit on Saturday, families have been putting the names of missing loved ones on website.

The younger brother of Australian actor Hugh Sheridan is among the missing.

“Please. Anyone who is awake, please pray for my little brother Zachary who is on Mt Everest,” Mr Sheridan tweeted.

The families of two Queensland friends believed to be on a hike to the Mount Everest base camp are also desperate for any news of their whereabouts.

Ben Flanders and Jai Williams, both from the Brisbane area, were due to reach the camp on Saturday, according to Jai’s mother Deb Williams.

Ms Williams has pleaded for information from her son’s guide, Rahul Shrestha, on Facebook.

“Do you know if they made it, are they ok?” she wrote on Sunday morning.

“I am terrified I can’t get any information.”

The federal opposition has called on the Abbott government to offer every assistance towards the recovery effort in Nepal.

“Labor has asked the government for urgent advice about the safety of Australians reported to have been in the area at the time,” Opposition foreign spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek said in a statement today.

New Zealand says it stands ready to assist with financial and practical help, as authorities confirm that about 100 Kiwis in Nepal are safe and efforts to contact others continue.

Foreign aid agencies are already sending assistance to Nepal as the country grapples with the worst earthquake in more than 80 years.

Oxfam Australia chief executive Helen Szoke says a group of disaster specialists from the UK is flying in with supplies. “People are gathered in their thousands in open spaces and are scared, as there were several aftershocks,” Dr Szoke said in a statement.

Search for survivors

Tens of thousands of people were spending the night in the open under a chilly and thunderous sky after a powerful earthquake devastated Nepal on Saturday, killing nearly 1400, collapsing modern houses and ancient temples and triggering a landslide on Mount Everest.

Officials warned the death toll would rise as more reports came in from far-flung areas.

Inspector Yuvraj Khadka of Nepal’s national police force said that rescue effort was continuing through the night and the death toll had reached 1394 people.

The earthquake, which hit struck at 11.56am (4.11pm AEST), was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years.

It was strong enough to be felt all across the northern part of neighbouring India, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan, where a total of 50 people died.

As Nepal trembled, residents fled homes and buildings in panic. Walls tumbled, trees swayed, power lines came crashing down and large cracks opened up on streets and walls. Clouds of dust began to swirl all around.

Within hours of the quake, hospitals had filled up with hundreds of injured people. With organised relief and rescue lacking, many survivors were brought to hospitals by friends and relatives in motorised rickshaws, flatbed trucks and cars. Residents used their bare hands, crowbars and other tools to dig through rubble and rescue survivors.

More than two dozen aftershocks jolted the area after the first quake, which struck just before noon. At the time, Shrish Vaidya, who runs an advertising agency, was in his two-storey house outside the capital Kathmandu with his parents.

“It is hard to describe. The house was shaking like crazy. We ran out and it seemed like the road was heaving up and down,” Vaidya, 46, told The Associated Press. “I don’t remember anything like this before. Even my parents can’t remember anything this bad.”

Once the first shaking stopped, Vaidya thought his family could return indoors by evening. But the jolts kept coming, and they felt safer outdoors.

“It’s cold and windy so we are all sitting in the car listening to the news on FM radio,” he said. “The experts are saying it’s still not safe to go back inside. No one can predict how big the next aftershock will be.”

So the family ate dinner outside with the headlights of their car providing light. Vaidya was grateful his wife and 10-year-old son were on holiday in the U.S.

In his largely affluent neighbourhood of low-rise, sturdy homes in suburban Kathmandu the damage was relatively light. In other parts of the city where the buildings are older and poorly built people were not as lucky.

Forecasts called for rain and thunder showers later Saturday and Sunday and the temperatures were cold enough to make camping outside uncomfortable.

Thousands of people were spending the night at Tudikhel, a vast open ground in the middle of Kathmandu, just next to the old city that is lined with historic buildings and narrow lanes. Now it is in ruins.

People lay on plastic sheets or cardboard boxes, wrapped in blankets. Mothers kept their children warm; some lit fire with whatever wood they could find. Most were eating instant noodles and cookies.

Deepak Rauniar, a shop worker who was there with his friends, said: “We are too scared to go back to our apartment. It is surrounded closely by houses, most of them old. The houses could collapse while we are still sleeping.”

Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who was attending a summit in Jakarta, tried to rush back home but made it as far as Bangkok where his connecting flight to Kathmandu was cancelled because the capital’s international airport was shut down for commercial flights.

Indian air force planes were allowed to bring in 43 tons of relief material, including tents and foods, and nearly 200 rescuers, India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said. The planes were returning to New Delhi with Indian nationals who were stranded in Kathmandu. India’s state-run Air India announced that it would begin relief flights to the Nepalese capital Sunday.

Hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overcrowded, running out of room for storing dead bodies and running out of emergency supplies, the United Nations said in a statement.

“The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise,” U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon said. “It is clear that very many lives have been lost. There has also been significant damage to Nepal’s irreplaceable cultural heritage.”

While the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster were yet to be known, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world, and its rich Hindu culture. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, relies heavily on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.

A mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, said an avalanche swept the face of Mt. Everest after the earthquake, and government officials said at least 10 climbers were killed and 30 injured. Their nationalities were not immediately known.

Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, a Dane who was climbing the Everest with a Belgian, Jelle Veyt, said on his Facebook page that they were at Khumbu Icefall , a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow close to base camp at altitude 5,000 meters, when the earthquake hit.

“Right now, it is pretty chaotic and we try to help those injured,” Pedersen wrote in an email to Danish news agency Ritzau.

Norwegian climber Teodor Glomnes Johansen told a newspaper in Norway that people at base camp were working on saving lives.

“All those who are unharmed organise help with the rescue efforts. Men, women and Sherpas are working side by side. The job right now is to assist the doctors in the camp here,” Glomnes Johansen told Norway’s VG newspaper.

The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the quake at 7.8. It said the quake hit at 11:56am local time at Lamjung, about 80km northwest of Kathmandu. Its depth was only 11km, the largest shallow quake since the 8.2 temblor off the coast of Chile on April 1, 2014.

The shallower the quake the more destructive power it carries.

A magnitude 7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while an 8 magnitude quake can cause tremendous damage. This means Saturday’s quake - with the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 - was about 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.

The quake occurred at the boundary between the two pieces, or plates, of Earth’s crust, one of which supports India to the south and the other Eurasia to the north. The Indian Plate is moving at 45 millimetres a year under the Eurasian Plate, and this results in earthquakes once every 500 year on an average, said Marin Clark, a geophysicist at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

So the quake was “definitely not a surprise,” she said. Over millions of years, such quakes have led to the uplift of the Himalayas. Nepal suffered its worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.

The power of Saturday’s tremors brought down several buildings in the centre of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers.

Among them was the nine-story Dharahara Tower, one of Kathmandu’s landmarks built by Nepal’s royal rulers as a watchtower in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognised historical monument. It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath.

Hundreds of people buy tickets on weekends to go up to the viewing platform on the eighth story, but it was not clear how many were up there when the tower collapsed. Video footage showed people digging through the rubble of the tower, looking for survivors.

The Kathmandu Valley is listed as a World Heritage site and is a collection of seven locations around Nepal’s capital that reflect the country’s rich religious history. The Buddhist stupas, public squares and Hindu temples are some of the most well-known sites in Kathmandu, and now some of the most deeply mourned.

The head of the U.N. cultural agency, Irina Bokova, said in a statement that UNESCO was ready to help Nepal rebuild from “extensive damage, including to historic monuments and buildings of the Kathmandu Valley.”

Nepali journalist and author Shiwani Neupane tweeted: “The sadness is sinking in. We have lost our temples, our history, the places we grew up.”

Climbers caught in earthquake on Everest

An avalanche at Mount Everest base camp triggered by a massive earthquake killed at least 13 people, including foreign climbers, a Nepalese official said.

“We don’t have the details yet, but 10 have been reported dead so far, including foreign climbers,” Gyanendra Kumar Shrestha from Nepal’s tourism department told AFP.

AFP Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly said she was caught in the earthquake that ripped though large parts of the country.

“We got caught in an earthquake on Everest. We are both okay … snowing here so no choppers coming,” she said in an SMS on approach to base camp while on assignment.

Two experienced mountaineers reported that panic erupted at base camp which was full of climbing teams and had been “severely damaged”, while one said the quake triggered a “huge avalanche”.

“Running for life from my tent. Unhurt. Many many people up the mountain,” tweeted Romanian climber Alex Gavan who had been preparing to climb up nearby Lhotse, the world’s fourth highest mountain.

Another climber Daniel Mazur said his team was trapped at camp one higher up the mountain in the wake of the earthquake.

“A massive earthquake just hit Everest. Base camp has been severely damaged. Our team is caught in Camp 1. Please pray for everyone,” he also tweeted.

Everest was hit by an avalanche last year that killed 16 guides and triggered an unprecedented shutdown of the mountain.

About 700 climbers are in Solukhumbhu district that includes Everest, with 300 thought to be at base camp itself, deputy superintendent of police Chandra Dev Rai said.

“We are trying to reach them to see if they are safe, but the phones are not working,” he told AFP from Solukhumbhu town through which climbers pass en route to the mountain.

Hundreds dead in Nepal quake, avalanche triggered on Everest

A massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake killed hundreds of people Saturday as it ripped through large parts of Nepal, toppling office blocks and towers in Kathmandu and triggering an avalanche that hit Everest base camp.

Officials said at least 449 people are known to have died in Nepal but that the toll could be much higher, while more than two dozen people were also reported killed in neighbouring India, China and Bangladesh.

""The death toll based on information received on our network across the country has reached 449,"" Nepal's national police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam told AFP.

""Deaths have been reported from all regions except the far west. All our security personnel have been deployed to rescue and assist those in need.""

Officials said an avalanche had buried parts of Mount Everest's base camp in Nepal where hundreds of mountaineers have gathered at the start of the annual climbing season.

""An avalanche from Mt. Pumori has hit the base camp, burying a part of it,"" Gyanendra Kumar Shrestha, an official in Nepal's tourism department, told AFP.

""We are trying to assess how many are injured. There might be over 1,000 people there right now, including foreign climbers and Nepalese supporting staff.""

AFP Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly, on an assignment to Everest, was among those caught up in the chaos and reported that snowfall meant it was impossible for helicopters to reach the area.

Two experienced mountaineers said that panic erupted at base camp which was full of climbing teams and had been ""severely damaged"", while one said the quake triggered a ""huge avalanche"".

-- Historic tower collapses --

But the worst damage was reported in Kathmandu, where the historic nine-storey Dharahara tower, a major tourist attraction, was among the buildings to have been brought down.

At least a dozen bodies were taken away from the ruins of the 19th century tower, according to an AFP photographer who saw similar scenes of multiple casualties in other parts of the city.

While contact with Nepal was sporadic, a senior Nepalese diplomat warned that the final toll could run into many hundreds.

""We have received reports that there is a big loss of property and life in Nepal,"" Krishna Prasad Dhakal, the deputy chief of mission at Nepal's Embassy in New Delhi, told AFP.

""Possibly hundreds of people have died in various parts of the country, particularly in Kathmandu and Pokhara.""

At least 26 people were known to have died in India, including 17 in the eastern state of Bihar, while buildings in the capital New Delhi had to be evacuated.

The United States Geological Survey and India's meteorological service said the shallow quake struck 77 kilometres (48 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 0611 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside their homes.

""The walls of houses have collapsed around me onto the road. All the families are outside in their yards huddled together,"" an AFP reporter said in Kathmandu.

Another resident recounted scenes of panic and mayhem.

""Everything started shaking. Everything fell down. The walls around the main road have collapsed. The national stadium's gates have collapsed,"" Anupa Shrestha said.

The quake tore through the middle of highways in the capital and also caused damage to the country's only international airport which was briefly closed.

Kari Cuelenaere, an official at the Dutch embassy, said the impact had swept the water out of a swimming pool at a Kathmandu hotel where Dutch national day was being celebrated.

""It was horrible, all of a sudden all the water came up out of the pool and drenched everyone, the children started screaming,"" Cuelenaere told AFP. ""Some parts of the city fell down, there was dust rising... There were many (rescue) helicopters.

Aftershock tremors could be felt more than two hours after the initial quake.

Initially measured at 7.5 magnitude, the quake was later adjusted to 7.8, with a depth of 15 kilometres, the USGS said. It hit 73 kilometres east of the tourist town of Pokhara.

- Tremors felt across region -

Witnesses and media reports said the tremors lasted between 30 seconds and two minutes.

""We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal,"" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet.

The AFP office in Delhi was evacuated twice following the quake.

China's official Xinhua news agency said that two people, including an 83-year-old woman, were killed in the Tibet region as a result of the quake.

The earthquake was also felt across large areas of Bangladesh, triggering panic in the capital Dhaka as people rushed out onto the streets.

In the garment manufacturing hub of Savar, on the outskirts of Dhaka, at least 50 workers were injured after the quake set off a stampede in a garment factory, according to the private Jamuna television.

The area has a history of earthquakes, with a 6.8 magnitude quake that hit eastern Nepal in August 1988 killing 721 people.

A magnitude 8.1 quake killed 10,700 people in Nepal and eastern India in 1934.

International aid groups rushed to respond today to a massive earthquake in Nepal that claimed more than 1,000 lives as aftershocks and severed communications hampered rescue efforts.



""We do not yet know the scope of the damage, but this could be one of the deadliest and most devastating earthquakes since the 1934 tremor which devastated Nepal and Bihar,"" said Jagan Chapagain, Asia/Pacific director of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).



The IFCR said it was extremely concerned about the fate of rural villages close to the epicentre of the quake, some 80 kilometres from the capital Kathmandu.""Roads have been damaged or blocked by landslides and communication lines are down preventing us from reaching local Red Cross branches to get accurate information,"" said Chapagain in a statement.""We anticipate that there will be considerable destruction and loss of life.""Other aid organisations responding to the emergency also struggled to assess the needs with communications cut off around the Himalayan nation.""Communication is currently very difficult.

UNICEF Canada is calling on Canadians to donate to the humanitarian group so it can help the people of Nepal following a deadly earthquake.

At least 1,180 were killed in the 7.8 magnitude quake on Saturday. The violently shaking earth collapsed houses, levelled centuries-old temples and triggered avalanches on Mt. Everest.

President and CEO David Morley said 42 per cent of the population of Nepal is under 18 years of age and they are the most vulnerable in an emergency.

“An earthquake of this size can be deadly, toppling buildings, and destroying roads and infrastructure,” Morley said in a statement released Saturday.

UNICEF has been working in Nepal since the 1960’s and is already on the ground, working to meet the needs of everyone affected.

“We are keeping our promise to Nepal’s children to always be there for them — in this emergency and every day,” he said.

Morley said communications are down so they don’t yet have a full picture of the devastation, but it’s clear there is loss of life and homes destroyed.

It was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years.

Ottawa is advising anyone concerned about Canadian citizens in the affected area to call Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada’s 24/7 Emergency Watch and Response Centre at 1-800-387-3124.

NEW DELHI: Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi visited the Nepal embassy in the capital on Friday to pay his tributes to victims of the earthquake, but ended up getting panned on social media for apparently referring to some text on his cellphone while writing the condolence message. TV cameras were quick to spot the cellphone in front of him as he sat writing the message on the visitors' book.TV grabs showed him looking at his phone while writing, apparently to copy down the text he may have earlier keyed in.In no time the Twitterati were making fun of him with the hashtag #PappuCantWriteS**la.The same Twitterati had recently backed him when he took on the Modi government on the issue of net neutrality.On Friday, Rahul met ambassador Deep Kumar Upadhyay, and wrote in the condolence book: ""Over the last week, the world has watched in horror as the tragedy in Nepal unfolded.Some wounds will never heal, but as Nepal begins the hard task of rebuilding... the people of India stand with you in strength and solidarity .""(Picture courtesy: @iYashwant/Twitter)

News of Nepal’s earthquake shook Apeckchya Karki out of bed in her Minneapolis home around 3 a.m. Saturday, setting in motion frantic efforts to check the welfare of her large family back in Kathmandu.

Karki, president of the Association of Nepalese in Minnesota (ANMN), learned from her brother that their family was safe because many were attending a social gathering at a location that endured minimal damage during the quake.

Early Saturday, Karki said, ANMN gathered for an emergency board meeting to discuss relief efforts. By midmorning, the nonprofit posted a link on its website (anmn.org) for donations that it said would be directed to the Red Cross and other efforts in Nepal. ANMN — which was founded in 2004 — estimates that there are about 3,000 ­people of ethnic Nepali, Bhutanese and Tibetan heritage living in the Twin ­Cities.

“Fortunately I haven’t heard of anyone whose family was injured,” Karki said. “There’s a lot of loss with buildings or properties. I’m hearing stories of people staying outside of their homes. People are still scared. Tonight it will be hard for people to even sleep inside.”

Karki said most people in the Twin Cities have reached family members through social media or cellphones because land lines in Nepal have been weakened. She said she spoke with one local woman whose early morning phone conversation with her mother was interrupted by her mother shouting, “Earthquake!” and the phone disconnecting. Later, Karki said, the woman learned that her mother was unharmed.

In addition to accepting donations through its website, ANMN also established an e-mail for any questions: anmn.fundraising@gmail.com

BK Rastogi, Director General of Institute of Seismological Research today said that people in Gujarat don’t need to worry about the earthquake in Nepal or even its aftershocks.

Rastogi said, “The magnitude of earthquake Nepal has witnessed can cause damage to 300 km area around the epicenter. Beyond 300 km, there can be impacts of earthquake but not damage. Gujarat is far away from Nepal, and people here don’t need to worry about either today’s shock or aftershocks.”

Rastogi said it has been observed in the past that aftershocks are lower in intensity compared to the original shock.

He however said that areas of Nepal, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar should take care for at least two days during which aftershocks can be experienced.

“Suppose if the main shock has caused some damage to weak buildings, the aftershock can cause further damage to same buildings, and therefore those living in weak such structures should leave them for at least two-three days in Nepal, UP and Bihar.”

Rastogi said, the earthquake in Nepal will not trigger activation of other fault line, so far as Gujarat is concerned.

Rastogi however said that Gujarat is vulnerable land so far as earthquakes are concerned and therefore buildings should be properly designed.

Dan Fredinburg, a Google executive, was killed on Mount Everest in an avalanche triggered by the massive, 7.8 magnitude earthquake that rocked Nepal on Saturday. At least 17 climbers died on the mountain.

Fredinburg's sister confirmed his death in an Instagram post:

This is Dans little sister Megan. I regret to inform all who loved him that during the avalanche on Everest early this morning our Dan suffered from a major head injury and didn't make it. We appreciate all of the love that has been sent our way thus far and know his soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us. All our love and thanks to those who shared this life with our favorite hilarious strong willed man. He was and is everything to us. Thank you.

""Our thoughts and prayers go out to Dan’s family and friends whilst we pray too for all those who have lost their lives in one of the greatest tragedies ever to hit this Himalayan nation,"" it reads in part. The statement also said that two other climbers sustained non-life threatening injuries.

Tom Briggs, the company's marketing director, told The Guardian that Fredinburg and the others ""saw the avalanche coming and were able to make a run for it but the camp was right in the middle of it.""

Fredinburg headed up privacy for Google X, the company's secretive ideas lab, and had worked at the Internet giant since 2007. According to his LinkedIn profile, he was involved with initiatives ranging from Google's self-driving car to ""Project Loon,"" which aspires to provide balloon-powered Internet access to remote areas. He also co-founded Google Adventure, which, according to the entrepreneur hub Startup Grind, aims to ""translate the Google Street View concept into extreme, exotic locations like the summit of Mount Everest or the Great Barrier Reef off Australia.""

The Guardian reported in April that he was part of a group of climbers who were preparing to summit the mountain one year after an avalanche killed twelve sherpas, in what had been the deadliest incident on the mountain to date. According to the newspaper, it was ""an open secret"" that a Street View camera was being carried to the summit.

Fredinburg posted frequent Instagram updates documenting his journey:

Twin powerful earthquakes shook Nepal Saturday, leaving more than 700 people dead in the country. The quake also strongly jolted the neighboring regions in China's Tibet Autonomous Region. A total of 13 people were killed and another four remain missing in Tibet, local authorities said.

According to Georgian Embassy to India, which also covers Nepal, there were no reports of Georgian civilians injured or killed in Saturday's earthquakes.

Israel was sending a delegation to Nepal Saturday to determine what help it can offer after the massive earthquake there that claimed more than 1,000 lives, officials said.

The military delegation of ""medical, search and rescue, logistics and population assistance professionals"" was due to fly out at midnight, an army statement said.

A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the advance team ""will land near the affected zone and make its preparations until it becomes possible to land in Nepal"".

Besides offering aid to Nepal, the delegation will also provide Israelis ""the means necessary to return to Israel"", the statement added.

Israel's emergency medical service also announced it would be sending a delegation of paramedics and doctors to Nepal to provide care for both locals and Israelis there.

A statement from Magen David Adom said an aircraft from Israel with equipment and professionals would depart early Sunday to provide immediate help and set up base for further delegations.

Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said there were ""thousands"" of Israelis in Nepal, adding that no fatalities among them were reported.

Rescue efforts in Nepal are intensifying after at least 2000 people were killed in the country's worst earthquake in more than 80 years.

Officials fear the death toll could rise as the desperate search for survivors continues.

Many countries and international charities have offered aid to Nepal to deal with the disaster.

The shallow 7.8 quake struck at midday (local time) on Saturday in central Nepal, about 81 kilometres northwest of the capital Kathmandu. It caused massive damage in the Kathmandu Valley.

Victims have also been reported in India, Bangladesh, Tibet and on Mt Everest.

A strong earthquake aftershock struck India and Nepal tonight, shaking buildings in New Delhi and triggering an avalanche in the Himalayas. The United States Geological Survey said the tremor was 6.7 magnitude.

Over a third of Nepal's 75 districts have suffered severe damage, and some villages close to the epicentre have had 80 percent of the houses destroyed. In some cases, whole villages are reported to have been buried by landslides.

Australian authorities are trying to contact hundreds of their people, with about 350 still not confirmed as safe.

Desperate rescue efforts underway

The death toll could rise, as the situation is unclear in remote areas which remain cut off or hard to access.

Many mountain roads are cracked or blocked by landslides.

Scores of bodies have been ferried to hospitals in the capital Kathmandu, many of which are struggling to cope with the number of injured.

More than 700 have died in the capital alone.

Medics are expecting a fresh influx of patients on Sunday as supplies run low.

Rescuers in places used their bare hands to dig for survivors still buried underneath piles of rubble and debris overnight on Saturday.

Army officer Santosh Nepal told the Reuters news agency that he and his soldiers had to dig a passage into a collapsed three-storey residential building in Kathmandu using pickaxes because bulldozers could not get through the ancient city's narrow streets.

""We believe there are still people trapped inside,"" he told Reuters.

Many historic buildings in the capital, including the Darahara Tower, have been destroyed.

Kunda Dixit, who edits the Nepali Times, said the earthquake created so much thick dust he thought Kathmandu had been completely destroyed.

He told Radio New Zealand National's Sunday Morning that he was on a retreat with other journalists on a mountain overlooking the city when the quake struck.

""It was so violent that the jolt - I felt like the whole mountain had moved about a metre and a half northward,"" he said.

""Then we looked down at the city and just couldn't believe our eyes. It was shrouded in dust. It was like a dust storm. We were convinced, actually, that the whole city had been destroyed.""

Mr Dixit said about 200,000 people left homeless by the quake were sleeping in tents overnight in very cold conditions.

Immediately after the quake, residents came out into the streets of Kathmandu, with mobile phone networks and other communications disrupted.

Bodies recovered after avalanche

Seventeen bodies have been recovered after an avalanche triggered by the earthquake buried part of Mt Everest's Base Camp sparking fears for hundreds of climbers on the mountain.

The Mountaineering Association said it was the worst disaster ever on the mountain.

It said a further 61 people were injured and the first rescue helicopters had only now been able to get in to fly them to a medical centre.

There are 100 climbers at Everest Camps One and Two above base camp and all are safe, according to the Mountaineering Association.

But it said it will be difficult to evacuate them because the Icefall Route back to Everest Base Camp was damaged.

It is the start of the main climbing season and officials estimate at least 1000 climbers including 400 foreigners were either at Base Camp or up the mountain when the quake struck.

About 150 New Zealanders are confirmed as safe in Nepal.

But Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully said communication problems were hampering efforts to clarify how many more New Zealanders were unaccounted for.

One New Zealander in Kathmandu, Prue Smith, described the experience as frightening and said people around her were injured by falling bricks.

""We saw cracks emerging in the walls surrounding us - rubble was falling down.""

Aid pledged

Kathamandu airport has re-opened and aid flights have started delivering desperately needed supplies.

The US has said it is sending a disaster response team to Nepal and has released an initial $US1m to address immediate needs, according to US aid agency USAid.

Indian air force planes have landed with 43 tonnes of relief material, including tents and food, and nearly 200 rescuers.

Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has pledged help for the Nepalese authorities.

UK Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK ""will do all"" it can to help in the aftermath of the earthquake, and French President Francois Hollande said France was ready to respond to any request for aid and assistance.

New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said the Government is to contribute $1 million aid, but may consider further funds. He said New Zealand offered a search and rescue team, but at this stage Nepal has indicated it would prefer to use teams from countries which were closer neighbours.

How likely is this kind of earthquake?

Yesterday's devastating earthquake, which has killed hundreds and caused widespread damage is a relatively rare event, according to the US Geological Survey.

Here is its take on what happened:

The earthquake was the result of 'thrust faulting' between the subducting India plate and the overriding Eurasia plate to the north.

At the location of the quake, approximately 80 km northwest of Kathmandu, the India plate is converging with Eurasia at a rate of 45 mm/yr towards the north-northeast, driving the uplift of the Himalayan mountain range.

The preliminary location, size and focal mechanism of the 25 April earthquake are consistent with it happening on the main subduction thrust point between the India and Eurasia plates.

Although a major plate boundary with a history of earthquakes, large shakes on the Himalayan thrust are rare in documented history.

Just four events of magnitude 6 or larger have occurred within 250km of the 25 April 25 earthquake over the past century.

One of these, a 6.9 quake in August 1988, 240 km to the southeast of the latest event, caused close to 1500 fatalities.

The largest, a magnitude 8 event known as the 1934 Nepal-Bihar earthquake, occurred in a similar location to the 1988 quake. It severely damaged Kathmandu and is thought to have caused around 10,600 fatalities.

A powerful earthquake struck the Nepal region on Saturday, causing widespread casualties and triggering an avalanche on Mount Everest.

The key information known at this time:

HOW BAD IS THE DAMAGE?

It's too early to tell, but early indications suggest the early figure of 906 people killed in four countries is likely to rise substantially in the coming days. The magnitude-7.8 quake was the worst to hit Nepal in eight decades and caused damage and fatalities in neighboring countries as well. In addition to the hundreds of deaths in Nepal, some 20 people were killed in India, six in Tibet, and two in Bangladesh. Two Chinese citizens died at the Nepal-China border.

The earthquake hit a heavily populated area of Nepal, including the capital, Kathmandu, and its impact spread far beyond the Kathmandu Valley. Strong aftershocks were felt an hour after the initial temblor.

Earthquake experts are preparing for high numbers in terms of deaths and damage.

""This is a very large earthquake in a significantly populated region with infrastructure that has been damaged in past earthquakes,"" U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. ""Significant fatalities are expected.""

Local hospitals were already filling with injured residents, and Kathmandu's international airport was shut down, hampering initial relief efforts in the isolated mountainous country.

___

WHAT HAPPENED? AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

Seismologist Earle said the quake happened on what is known as a ""thrust fault."" That describes the situation when one piece of the Earth's crust is moving beneath another piece.

In this case, it's the Indian plate that is moving north at 45 millimeters (1.7 inches) a year under the Eurasian plate to the north, Earle said. It's a different type of earthquake than the one that caused the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

""This is what builds the Himalayan mountain range,"" Earle said.

The region and particular fault has a history of damaging earthquakes, including four temblors with magnitudes greater than 6.0 in the past 100 years, Earle said, warning that landslides are a particular worry now, given the steep slopes in the region.

___

WHAT DOES 'RED ALERT' ISSUED BY U.S. OFFICIALS MEAN?

The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was strong enough to merit a ""red alert"" for shaking-related fatalities and economic losses. It said that ""high casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread. Past red alerts have required a national or international response.""

Quick USGS calculations estimate a two-thirds likelihood of between 1,000 and 100,000 fatalities and damage between $100 million and $10 billion. Scientists estimate that more than 105 million people felt at least moderate shaking during the quake.

___

WHAT HAPPENED ON MOUNT EVEREST?

A devastating avalanche swept across Mount Everest after the earthquake, claiming at least eight lives with an unspecified number of people missing and injured.

The avalanche struck near one of the famed mountain's most dangerous spots. It swept down between the Khumbu Icefall, known for its harsh conditions, and the base camp used by international climbing expeditions.

There were unverified reports of avalanches on other parts of the mountain. Nepalese officials said some 30 people were injured at the base camp.

Facebook postings by climbers suggested that some people may have been buried in their tents when the avalanche hit. Climbers and their support teams were leaving the base camp Saturday looking for safer locations.

More than 4,000 climbers have scaled the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit since 1953, when it was first conquered by New Zealand climber Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay.

HOW PREPARED IS NEPAL TO COPE WITH SUCH A CRISIS?

Nepal is a relatively poor country without extensive resources despites its rich cultural heritage and spectacular mountain scenery.

It has been plagued by instability in recent years, and general strikes have recently brought chaotic scenes to Kathmandu.

Nepal's constitution was supposed to have been written by the Constituent Assembly that was elected in 2008, following the end of a 10-year Maoist insurgency and the overthrow of the centuries-old monarchy, but the assembly was hampered by infighting and never finished its work.

The current assembly was chosen in 2013, but has faced the same problem.

Neighboring Pakistan has offered help, and an international aid effort is likely to begin once Kathmandu's international airport can be reopened

World leaders and global charities offered condolences and emergency aid to Nepal following the earthquake Saturday while grappling to understand the scope of the disaster.

With Internet and cellphone communications spotty, and many roads closed due to damage, the outside world does not yet have a clear picture of what is most needed following the earthquake that authorities say has killed at least 1300 people.

But it is clear that help is needed - and fast.

Peter Drury/Fairfax NZ A bloodied monk is carried to safety by rescue workers and earthquake survivors.

""We are treating it as a big emergency,"" said Ben Pickering, Save the Children's humanitarian adviser in Britain. ""We know the damage is extensive and that access into rural areas will be very, very difficult for everybody.""

Pickering said it is too early for a detailed assessment but that the overall picture is grim.

""Children will be affected in many ways. Physical injuries. Separated from families,"" he said. ""The priority now is understanding the scale, what the emergency needs are right now and in the coming weeks.""

Mike Scott/Fairfax NZ A collapsed building in Kathmandu following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake.

Some charities are assembling disaster teams - based on the assumption that sanitation, shelter and medical help are urgently required - but the most convenient pathway into Nepal is not available because the international airport in Kathmandu has been shut down by the quake.

Pickering said Save the Children plans to send a specialist team as soon as possible to help with food, water and sanitation in the country, which is one of the world's poorest.

The European Union is considering ""some budget support"" to Nepal, according to a joint statement on Saturday by the EU's foreign policy chief, development chief and humanitarian chief. It did not provide details or amounts.

Reuters A collapsed building in Kathmandu, where more than 300 were killed.

They said the EU is also looking into ""how we can help Nepal to deal with the destroyed and damaged buildings and how to help its citizens.""

""The full extent of the casualties and damage is still unknown but reports indicate they will likely be high, both in terms of loss of life, injuries and damage to cultural heritage,"" they said.

British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders also promised help for Nepal. Cameron said on Twitter that Britain ""will do all we can to help those caught up in it.""

Reuters The body of a victim is carried out on a stretcher from a collapsed building.

Cameron and Merkel did not specify what aid would be forthcoming, but others were more specific. Norwegian Foreign Minister Boerge Brende said the Scandinavian country would allocate 30 million kroner (NZ$5.07 million) to aid work, and that the money would be sent through the United Nations and charitable organisations.

""We are following the situation closely and we will find out whether to contribute further when we know more,"" Brende said in a statement.

Italy's Foreign Ministry said it has made available €300,000 (NZ$429,000) of emergency aid for earthquake victims. The aid will be channeled through the International Red Cross.

French President Francois Hollande said France is ""ready to respond to requests for help and assistance"" from Nepalese authorities.

French aid group Doctors of the World (Medecins du monde) said it has mobilised its workers in Nepal - based in Kathmandu and Chautara to work on maternal and infant health - to help quake victims. It is sending more staffers and medical aid to the region immediately.

Among other countries sending condolences was Mexico, which suffered an 8.1-magnitude earthquake that killed an estimated 9500 people in the nation's capital in 1985. Mexico's foreign ministry said it stood in solidarity with the government of Nepal and the relatives of the earthquake victims.

KATHMANDU // A powerful earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday, killing at least 1,180 people across four countries as the shaking earth collapsed houses, levelled centuries-old temples and triggered avalanches on Mt Everest.

It was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years.

At least 1,130 people were confirmed dead across Nepal, according to the police. Another 34 were killed in India, 12 in Tibet and two in Bangladesh. Two Chinese citizens died in the Nepal-China border. The death toll is almost certain to rise.

The UAE’s President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed sent a message of condolences to the president of Nepal and wished quick recovery to the injured.

Netra Tandan, a counsellor at the Nepalese embassy in Abu Dhabi, said its citizens in the UAE were most likely to contact their families in Kathmandu or Pokhara.

Meanwhile, Nepalese residents in the UAE can contact the embassy for consular assistance.

It was a few minutes before noon when the quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 7.8, began to rumble across the densely populated Kathmandu Valley, rippling through the capital Kathmandu and spreading in all directions.

Shrish Vaidya, a businessman, was with his family in his two-story house on the outskirts of Kathmandu, when the quake struck.

“It is hard to describe. The house was shaking like crazy. We ran out and it seemed like the road was heaving up and down,” he said. “I don’t remember anything like this before. Even my parents can’t remember anything this bad.”

A magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit about an hour later, and at least 16 aftershocks continued to jolt the region for hours. Residents ran out of homes and buildings in panic. Walls tumbled, trees swayed, power lines came crashing down and large cracks opened up on streets and walls. And clouds of dust began to swirl all around.

“Our village has been almost wiped out. Most of the houses are either buried by landslide or damaged by shaking,” said Vim Tamang, a resident of Manglung village near the epicentre. He said half of the village folks are either missing or dead. “All the villagers have gathered in the open area. We don’t know what to do. We are feeling helpless,” he said.

Within hours of the quake, hospitals began to fill up with hundreds of injured people. With organised relief and rescue largely absent, many of the injured were brought to hospitals by friends and relatives in motorised rickshaws, flatbed lorries and cars. It was also residents themselves who used bare hands, crowbars and other tools to dig through rubble and rescue survivors.

In Kathmandu, dozens of people gathered in the car park of Norvic International Hospital, where thin mattresses were spread on the ground for patients rushed outside, some wearing hospital pyjamas.

Doctors and nurses hooked up some patients to intravenous drips in the car park, or gave people oxygen.

As night fell, thousands of scared residents continued to camp out in parks and compounds, too scared to return to their homes. Meteorologists forecast rain and thunderstorms for Saturday night and Sunday.

Prime minister Sushil Koirala, who was attending a summit in Jakarta, tried to rush back home but made it as far as Bangkok where his connecting flight to Kathmandu was cancelled because the capital’s international airport was shut down.

While the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster are yet to be ascertained, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, is heavily reliant on tourism.

The US. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the quake at 7.8. It said the quake hit at 11:56am local time at Lamjung, about 80 kilometres north-west of Kathmandu. Its depth was only 11 kilometres, the largest shallow quake since the 8.2 temblor off the coast of Chile on April 1, 2014.

The shallower the quake the more destructive power it carries.

A major factor in the damage was that many of the buildings were not built to be quake-proof. An earthquake this size in Tokyo or Los Angeles, which have building codes for quake resistance, would not be nearly as devastating.

The Kathmandu Valley is densely populated with nearly 2.5 million people, and the quality of buildings is often poor.

Nepal suffered its worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.

The sustained quake also was felt in India’s capital of New Delhi and several other Indian cities.

India’s prime minister Narendra Modi called a meeting of top government officials to review the damage and disaster preparedness in parts of India that felt strong tremors. The Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Sikkim, which share a border with Nepal, have reported building damage. There have also been reports of damage in the northeastern state of Assam.

Pakistan’s prime minister Nawaz Sharif offered “all possible help” that Nepal may need.

A powerful earthquake — the country's worst in 80 years — rocked mountainous Nepal on Saturday, killing more than 1,800 people and leveling buildings and centuries-old temples. Dozens if not hundreds remained trapped under mounds of rubble.

Hospitals in the capital of Katmandu were so crowded that many of the injured were treated outside in the open, according to local media. The magnitude-7.8 quake, which shook a wide swath of northern India, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan, also triggered avalanches in the Himalayas, killing at least 10 people on Mount Everest.

Nepal police said at least 1,865 people were killed. Given the scale of the destruction, the death toll was expected to rise. An emergency Cabinet meeting designated 29 districts as crisis zones, the Home Affairs Ministry said.

Tens of thousands of people, fearful of aftershocks bringing down more buildings, gathered outside during the night.

""My entire neighborhood is still in shock,"" said Chiranjibi Gurung in Katmandu. ""My children who were inside the houses at the time of the earthquake are scared to go inside now even at this time of the night.""

Around 180 bodies were pulled from the ruins of the nine-story Dharhara Tower in the center of the capital, China's official Xinhua News Agency reports. It said about 200 were feared trapped in the rubble of the tower in the city's historic Basantapur Durbar Square.

""We had heard the earthquake stories from our ancestors and how I remember my grandparents telling me about the devastation of the 1934 earthquake and how it uprooted the Dharahara Tower then,"" said Sabita Lal of Katmandu. ""I saw the same thing happen today to the tower. It was a massive one.""

Another Katmandu resident, Deepen Bista, whose house was damaged, said the big jolt ""was longer than we had experienced before, it lasted a little more than a minute."" The downtown area of the capital — with old houses and narrow lanes — was hardest hit, he said.

City hospitals were quickly overwhelmed. Dozens were gathered in the parking lot of Norvic International Hospital, where thin mattresses were spread on the ground for patients rushed outside, some wearing hospital pajamas. A woman with a bandage on her head sat in a set of chairs pulled from the hospital waiting room. Doctors and nurses had hooked up some patients to IV drips in the parking lot, or were giving people oxygen.

The quake struck before noon local time about 50 miles northwest of Katmandu in an area that the U.S. Geological Survey calls one of the most seismically hazardous regions on Earth. It is at the spot where the India plate collides with the Eurasia plate in a process that created the towering Himalayas.

The quake, which was felt as far away as Lahore in Pakistan, Lhasa in Tibet, and Dhaka, Bangladesh, was followed by about 15 aftershocks, including one registered at a magnitude of 6.6. At least 34 were killed in India, 12 in Tibet and two in Bangladesh. Two Chinese citizens died on the Nepal-China border.

Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat said on Twitter that the quake had destroyed about 90% of about 1,000 homes and huts in the Laprak and Barpak villages near the epicenter.

The humanitarian aid group Oxfam said it was sending a team of technical experts from Britain to provide clean water, sanitation and emergency food supplies. ""Communication is currently very difficult,"" said Cecilia Keizer, Oxfam country director in Nepal. ""Telephone lines are down, and the electricity has been cut off, making charging mobile phones difficult. The water is also cut off.""

Keizer said the quake had destroyed many of Katmandu's old houses and that at least one large apartment block had collapsed. ""People are gathered in the thousands in open spaces and are scared, as there have been several aftershocks,"" she said.

In Winchester, Va., Kriti Hada, a 20-year-old nursing student from Nepal who is attending Shenandoah University, said her sister in Nepal managed to get through by phone.

Although she, her mother and another sister were unhurt, they were frightened by the intensity and duration of the aftershocks, which are continuing, Hada told USA TODAY.

Hada said her relatives, like hundreds of others who survived the initial quake, were remaining outside until the seismic activity ceases. ""We have very limited open spaces and they are surrounded by tall buildings that are also fragile,"" Hada said.

Numerous countries around the world pledged immediate aid and supplies. The U.S. Mission in Nepal released an initial $1 million for immediate assistance. The embassy also said a U.S. search-and-rescue team is preparing to fly to Nepal. In addition, the U.S. Agency for International Development was sending a disaster assistance response team. India, Pakistan, China, France and Britain also said they would assist in the relief effort.

Within hours, an Indian Air Force C-130 landed at at Katmandu's airport with 39 disaster relief workers and 3.5 metric tons of supplies, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.

Several buildings collapsed in the center of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers. Among them was the Dharahara Tower, one of Katmandu's landmarks built by Nepal's royal rulers in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognized historical monument. It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath. The Katmandu Valley is densely populated with nearly 2.5 million people, and the quality of buildings is often poor.

Dhany Osman, an editor with The Straits Times of Singapore said he was at Katmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport when the quake struck.

""As bits of the ceiling began to fall, passengers who were waiting for their flights began to panic and started running out of the terminal, with some tripping over each other,"" he wrote. ""Despite the nearest exit door being just 10 (yards) away, a group of Nepali men smashed open a glass panel and climbed out of it. I tried telling people around me to calm down but they kept shoving each other to get out.""

Although the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster are yet to be ascertained, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, is heavily dependent on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain-climbing.

A Swedish woman, Jenny Adhikari, who lives in Nepal, told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that she was riding a bus in the town of Melamchi when the earth began to move.

""A huge stone crashed only about 20 (yards) from the bus,"" she was quoted as saying. ""All the houses around me have tumbled down. I think there are lot of people who have died,"" she told the newspaper by telephone. Melamchi is about 30 miles northeast of Kathmandu.

Although located on a major plate boundary with a history of large- to great-sized earthquakes, large earthquakes in this area are rare in the documented historical era, the USGS reports. Over the past century, just four events of magnitude 6.0 or larger have occurred within about 150 miles of Saturday's earthquake.

An earthquake's power increases by 10 times with each increase in the number of its scale. This means Saturday's earthquake — the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 — was 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.

Nepal quake death toll passes 1,000 BelfastTelegraph.co.uk Tens of thousands of people were spending the night in the open after a powerful earthquake devastated Nepal, killing more than 1,180 people. http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/nepal-quake-death-toll-passes-1000-31170367.html http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/article31170366.ece/4a474/AUTOCROP/h342/PANews%20BT_P-fee88981-c37b-4aa3-9afb-46eeade1e348_I1.jpg

Tens of thousands of people were spending the night in the open after a powerful earthquake devastated Nepal, killing more than 1,180 people.

The huge quake on Saturday toppled modern houses and ancient temples and triggered a landslide on Mount Everest. Officials warned the death toll would rise as more reports came in from far-flung areas.

The magnitude 7.8 earthquake, which originated outside the capital Kathmandu, was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years.

It was strong enough to be felt all across the northern part of neighbouring India, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan, where a total of 50 people died. The death toll in Nepal was 1,130, but was almost certain to rise, said officials.

As Nepal trembled, residents fled homes and buildings in panic. Walls tumbled, trees swayed, power lines came crashing down and large cracks opened up on streets and walls. Clouds of dust began to swirl all around.

Within hours of the quake, hospitals had filled up with hundreds of injured people. With organised relief and rescue largely absent, many were brought to hospitals by friends and relatives in motorised rickshaws, flatbed trucks and cars. Residents used their bare hands, crowbars and other tools to dig through rubble and rescue survivors.

More than two dozen aftershocks jolted the area after the first quake, which struck just before noon. At the time, Shrish Vaidya, who runs an advertising agency, was in his two-storey house outside the capital Kathmandu with his parents.

""It is hard to describe. The house was shaking like crazy. We ran out and it seemed like the road was heaving up and down,"" Vaidya, 46, told The Associated Press. ""I don't remember anything like this before. Even my parents can't remember anything this bad.""

Once the first shaking stopped, Mr Vaidya thought his family could return indoors by evening. But the jolts kept coming, and they felt safer outdoors.

""It's cold and windy so we are all sitting in the car listening to the news on FM radio,"" he said. ""The experts are saying it's still not safe to go back inside. No one can predict how big the next aftershock will be.""

In other parts of the city where the buildings are older and poorly built, people have not been as lucky.

Thousands of people were spending the night at Tudikhel, a vast open ground in the middle of Kathmandu, just next to the old city that is lined with historic buildings and narrow lanes. Now it is in ruins.

People lay on plastic sheets or cardboard boxes, wrapped in blankets. Mothers kept their children warm; some lit fire with whatever wood they could find.

Deepak Rauniar, a shop worker who was there with his friends, said: ""We are too scared to go back to our apartment. It is surrounded closely by houses, most of them old. The houses could collapse while we are still sleeping.""

Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who was attending a summit in Jakarta, tried to rush back home but made it as far as Bangkok where his connecting flight to Kathmandu was cancelled because the capital's international airport was shut for commercial flights.

Nepalese authorities did allow Indian Air Force planes to bring in 43 tons of relief material, including tents and foods, and nearly 200 rescuers from India's National Disaster Response Force. Air India announced that it would begin relief flights to the Nepalese capital on Sunday.

While the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster were yet to be known, the quake will put a huge strain on the resources of the poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world, and its rich Hindu culture. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, relies heavily on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.

A mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, said an avalanche swept the face of Mt Everest after the earthquake, and government officials said at least 10 climbers were killed and 30 injured. Their nationalities were not immediately known.

Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, a Dane who is climbing Everest with a Belgian, Jelle Veyt, said on his Facebook page that they were at Khumbu Icefall , a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow close to base camp at altitude 5,000 metres (16,500 feet), when the earthquake hit.

""Right now, it is pretty chaotic and we try to help those injured,"" Mr Pedersen wrote in an email to Danish news agency Ritzau.

Norwegian climber Teodor Glomnes Johansen told a newspaper in Norway that people at base camp were working on saving lives.

""All those who are unharmed organise help with the rescue efforts. Men, women and Sherpas are working side by side. The job right now is to assist the doctors in the camp here,"" Glomnes Johansen told VG newspaper.

The US Geological Survey put the magnitude of the quake at 7.8. It said the quake hit at 11:56 am local time at Lamjung, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu. Its depth was only 11 kilometeres (seven miles).

The shallower the quake the more destructive power it carries.

A magnitude 7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while an 8 magnitude quake can cause tremendous damage. This means Saturday's quake - with the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 - was about 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.

The quake occurred at the boundary between the two pieces, or plates, of Earth's crust, one of which supports India to the south and the other Eurasia to the north.

The power of the tremors brought down several buildings in the centre of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers.

Among them was the nine-story Dharahara Tower, one of Kathmandu's landmarks built by Nepal's royal rulers as a watchtower in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognised historical monument. It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath.

Hundreds of people buy tickets on weekends to go up to the viewing platform on the eighth storey, but it was not clear how many were up there when the tower collapsed. Video footage showed people digging through the rubble of the tower, looking for survivors.

Nepal suffered its worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.

The earthquake reduced many of the temples inside the city about 30 minutes away from the capital to rubble, she said, adding that she saw ""lots of people praying to the actual temples"" as aftershocks hit the city.""The streets are littered with bricks, debris, loads of dust,"" said Hunter, the sister of an ABC News employee. ""[It] was hard to see during the earthquake with all the dust.""A magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit about an hour after the initial earthquake and smaller aftershocks followed in the region for hours.Hunter said she watched as families ran to their homes to see if anyone was still inside.""Everyone was very scared,"" she said.

Nepal earthquake: 2350 dead, frantic search for survivors

Getty Images Emergency workers and bystanders clear debris while searching for survivors under a collapsed temple in Basantapur Durbar Square.

Rescuers are digging with their bare hands as bodies pile up in Nepal after an earthquake devastated the heavily crowded Kathmandu valley, killing at least 2350, and triggered a deadly avalanche on Mt Everest.

Army officer Santosh Nepal led a group of rescuers that worked all night to open a passage into a collapsed building in the capital of Kathmandu. They had to use pick axes because bulldozers could not get through the ancient city's narrow streets.

""We believe there are still people trapped inside,"" he told Reuters, pointing at concrete debris and twisted reinforcement rods that was once a three-storey residential building.

YouTube CCTV footage has started to emerge illustrating the devastating effect of the Nepal earthquake.

Among the capital's landmarks destroyed in the earthquake was the 60-metre Dharahara Tower, built in 1832 for the queen of Nepal, with a viewing balcony that had been open to visitors for the last 10 years.

A jagged stump was all that was left of the lighthouse-like structure. As bodies were pulled from the ruins, a policeman said up to 200 people had been trapped inside.







Bodies were still arriving at one hospital in Kathmandu, where police officer Sudan Shreshtha said his team had brought 166 corpses overnight.



""I am tired and exhausted, but I have to work and have the strength,"" Shreshtha told Reuters as an ambulance brought three more victims to the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital.



Bodies were heaped in a dark room; some covered with cloth, some not. A boy aged about seven lay, his face half missing and his stomach bloated like a football. The stench of death was overpowering.



Outside, a 30-year-old woman who had been widowed wailed: ""Oh Lord, oh God, why did you take him alone? Take me along with him also.""



Authorities also scrambled to provide shelter in the capital, Kathmandu, for thousands of people who spent the night outside in freezing temperatures and patchy rain, too afraid to return to their damaged homes.

People milled about in parks and streets strewn with rubble. The 7.9 magnitude quake struck at midday on Saturday at a busy time of year for the tourism-reliant country's trekking and climbing season, with an estimated 300,000 foreign tourists in the country.

REUTERS Officials say the death toll from Nepal's earthquake is skyrocketing after it sent tremors across northern India and triggered a fatal avalanche on Mt Everest. Nathan Frandino reports.

The government planned to pitch tents and turn schools and other public buildings into shelters, said Rameshwor Dangal, a home ministry official. It would also re-open roads and send helicopters to rescue people.

At least 18 people died after an avalanche swept through Mount Everest, the world's tallest peak at 8848-metres and long a magnet for adventurers, India's CNN-IBN reported. A product manager for Google was among the confirmed dead.

Around 300,000 foreign tourists were estimated to be in various parts of Nepal for the spring trekking and climbing season in the Himalayas, and officials were overwhelmed by calls from concerned friends and relatives.

Mike Scott Several buildings have collapsed in Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples, after a 7.8 magnitude quake.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed the well-being of just over 100 New Zealanders in Nepal.

The High Commission was continuing to seek information about the welfare of any other New Zealanders in the areas affected but efforts were hampered by damage to communication networks.

Those in the damaged areas were being asked to follow instructions from local authorities and to register their details at safetravel.govt.nz.

Hospitals across the impoverished nation of 28 million people struggled to cope with its worst quake in 81 years. They expected a fresh influx of patients on Sunday but medical supplies were running low.

Kathmandu's Bir Hospital had received 300 to 350 patients with serious injuries through Saturday, and most of them died, said paramedic Dinesh Chaudhary. He said the hospital was procuring medicines from shops outside.

PEOPLE STILL TRAPPED

The earthquake, centred 80 km east of the second city, Pokhara, was all the more destructive for being shallow.

Rescue operations had still not begun in towns in some remote areas.

Across the city, rescuers scrabbled through destroyed buildings, among them ancient, wooden Hindu temples.

""I can see three bodies of monks trapped in the debris of a collapsed building near a monastery,"" Indian tourist Devyani Pant told Reuters. ""We are trying to pull the bodies out and look for anyone who is trapped.""

Neighbouring India, where 44 people were reported killed in the quake and its aftershocks, sent military aircraft to Nepal with medical equipment and relief teams. It also said it had dispatched 285 members of its National Disaster Response Force.

In Tibet, the death toll climbed to 17, according to a tweet from China's state news agency, Xinhua.

International aid groups readied staff to go to Nepal to help provide clean water, sanitation and emergency food, while the United States, Britain and Pakistan were among countries providing search-and-rescue experts.

More than 1,000 climbers were on Everest at the start of their season when disaster struck.

FAR AND WIDE

Tremors were felt as far away as New Delhi and other northern cities in India, with reports that they had lasted up to a minute.

""Massive tremors have been felt here in Delhi and several other parts of India,"" said a newsreader on NDTV in Delhi.

""You can see pictures of our Delhi studios, where the windows rattled and everything shook for a very long time, for a minute perhaps or longer,"" she said as footage showed studio ceiling camera lights shaking.

""We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal,"" tweeted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The US Geological Survey revised the magnitude from 7.5 to 7.9 but then lowered it to 7.8.

Modi convened a high-level meeting with ministers and top officials to assess the situation. There were no preliminary reports of damage anywhere in India, Home Minister Rajnath Singh told the Press Trust of India.

Authorities closed Kathmandu's international airport and diverted flights. Across Asia perhaps 100 million people felt the quake, the USGS said.

TBT Reports

A massive tremor was felt in the capital and in many other areas of Bangladesh at around 12:15 pm on Saturday leaving two persons killed in the country.

One was identified as a woman leader of ruling Awami League’s local women front unit, Rokeya Khanam (50) died while being evacuating from her home during the quake in Pabna, and another was killed in the capital but details couldn’t be identified yet.

In Dhaka, residents of high-rise buildings were seen running down in panic as apartments swung.

A six-storied building in Old Dhaka’s Bangshal area tilted to one side due to the sudden earthquake and a 25-storey building tilted in Banani.

However, no casualties had been reported. Similar incidents had been reported from Savar, Khulna, Brahmanbaria, Kushtia, Mymensingh, Comilla, Chandpur and Rajshahi.

At least 50 readymade garment workers were injured at Ishwardi EPZ during panic evacuations. They were admitted to the Upazila Health Complex, doctors said.

Meanwhile, 60 more people were injured in the same types of incidents in Brahmanbaria, Kushtia and Sunamganj.

In India and Nepal, the quake damaged many buildings and left at least 970 people dead, BBC said quoting witnesses. The death toll is expected to rise. The Meteorological Department stated the epicentre of the earthquake was 745 km north-west of Bangladesh.

The US Geological Survey said the quake, initially measured at 7.7 but upgraded to 7.9 magnitude, struck 80 km (50 miles) east of Nepal’s Pokhara.

The death toll from a powerful earthquake that struck Nepal on Saturday rose to nearly 1000, a senior home ministry official told Reuters, with 181 people killed in the capital Kathmandu.

A Nepal-based think-tank, Asian Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs (AIDIA) sought Bangladesh’s immediate support with food and medical aid after a massive earthquake left a trail of destruction.

“We have limited number of hospitals and medical equipment due to its weak economy and political instability”, the AIDIA founder Sunil KC said.

Nepal’s Information Minister Minendra Rijal has already appealed for international help. “We need support from the various international agencies which are more knowledgeable and equipped to handle the kind of emergency we face now,” he was quoted as saying by BBC.

The Bangladeshi Ambassador in Nepal Mashfee Binte Shams said, “There are roughly Bangladeshi 100 families living here and they all are safe”. In India, many buildings collapsed in Assam and Bihar states and also in the Darjeeling hill region and foothills. The Bangladesh embassy in Nepal opened a ‘help desk’ for its nationals.

Indian Prime Minister Modi ordered an immediate dispatch of relief and medical teams to Nepal, and the evacuation of Indian tourists.

Meanwhile, Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif offered “all possible help” that Nepal may need after the earthquake.

A powerful earthquake which struck Nepal today has killed at least 876 people across four countries.

At least 862 people were confirmed dead in Nepal, according to the police. Another 20 were killed in India, six in Tibet and two in Bangladesh. Two Chinese citizens died at the Nepal-China border.

Given the scale of the destruction, the death toll is almost certain to rise, said home ministry official Laxmi Dhakal.

It was a few minutes before noon when the quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 7.8, began to rumble across the densely-populated Kathmandu Valley, rippling through the capital Kathmandu and spreading in all directions.

A magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit about an hour later and smaller aftershocks continued to jolt the region for hours.

Within hours, hospitals began to fill up with dozens of injured people. Many came to the main hospital in central Kathmandu.

Following the quake, Kathmandu’s international airport was shut down.

A senior mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, said an avalanche swept the face of Mount Everest after the earthquake and government officials said at least 30 people were injured.

Shallow and powerful

The quake’s epicentre was 50 miles north-west of Kathmandu and it had a depth of only seven miles, which is considered shallow in geological terms.

The shallower the quake the more destructive power it carries, and witnesses said the trembling and swaying of the earth went on for several minutes..

Several buildings collapsed in the centre of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers, said resident Prachanda Sual.

Among them was the nine-story Dharahara Tower, one of Kathmandu’s landmarks built by Nepal’s royal rulers as a watchtower in the 1800s and a Unesco-recognised historical monument. It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath.

Video footage showed people digging through the rubble of the bricks from the collapsed tower, looking for survivors.

A valley of 2.5 million

The Kathmandu Valley is densely populated with nearly 2.5 million people, and the quality of buildings is often poor.

The US Geological Survey revised the magnitude from 7.5 to 7.9 but then lowered it to 7.8.

It said the quake hit at 11.56am local time (6.11am GMT) at Lamjung.

A magnitude seven quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while an eight magnitude quake can cause tremendous damage.

Residents reported seeing trails of destruction – collapsed walls, broken windows and fallen telephone poles – as they drove through the capital, along with streets filled with terrified people.

But scattered reports also indicated that most buildings in the capital did not collapse.

“It’s too early to make any assessment but the damage isn’t as bad as it could have been,” said Liz Satow, the Nepal director for the aid group World Vision. She said she drove from Kathmandu to the nearby town of Lalitpur and said that while there was considerable damage, most buildings were still intact.

Nepal suffered its worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.

The sustained quake also was felt in India’s capital of New Delhi and several other Indian cities.

India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a meeting of top government officials to review the damage and disaster preparedness in parts of India that felt strong tremors. The Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Sikkim, which share a border with Nepal, have reported building damage. There have also been reports of damage in the northeastern state of Assam.

Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif offered “all possible help” that Nepal may need.

Hundreds die in Nepal quake

Powerful aftershocks have rocked Nepal, panicking survivors of a quake that killed more than 2350 and triggering fresh avalanches at Everest base camp, as rescuers dug through rubble in the devastated capital Kathmandu.

Terrified residents, many forced to camp out after Saturday’s quake reduced buildings to rubble, were jolted by this afternoon’s 6.7-magnitude aftershock that compounded the worst disaster to hit the impoverished Himalayan nation in more than 80 years.

interior Ministry spokesman Laxmi Dhakal says a total of 2352 people are confirmed dead across the country and 5838 people have been injured.

Officials in India said the toll there now stood at 60, while Chinese state media said 17 people had been killed in the Tibet region.

With scores of people still missing or seriously injured, the death toll is expected to climb further.

Hospitals were so stretched that medics had to set up tents outside to treat patients.

The historic nine-storey Dharahara tower, a major tourist attraction, was among the buildings brought down, with at least a dozen bodies recovered from the ruins of the 19th-century tower.

Offers of help poured in from around the world, with the United States and European Union announcing they were sending in disaster response teams and Australia giving $5 million in assistance, half of which will go to Australian non-government organisations .

India flew out its stranded citizens in military planes while a 62-strong Chinese rescue team arrived with sniffer dogs.

National police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam said the number known to have died in Nepal had risen to 1953 while 4629 people had been injured.

Officials in India said the toll there now stood at 53, mainly in the eastern state of Bihar, while Chinese state media said 17 people had been killed in the Tibet region.

Officials said 17 people were so far known to have died on Mount Everest where an avalanche triggered by the earthquake buried part of base camp.

It is the deadliest disaster in Everest’s history and comes almost exactly a year after an avalanche killed 16 sherpa guides.

AFP’s Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly, on an assignment at base camp, reported that six helicopters had managed to reach the mountain today after the weather improved overnight.

An injured person is loaded onto a rescue helicopter at Everest Base Camp, a day after an avalanche triggered by an earthquake devastated the camp.

A stunning image captured by the agency’s South Asia photo chief Roberto Schmidt showed a massive cloud of snow and debris cascading onto base camp, burying scores of climbers and flattening tents.

“People being stretchered out as choppers land — half a dozen this morning,” Kannampilly said in a text message.

“Weather clear, some snowfall.” The country’s cellphone network was working only sporadically, while large parts of the capital were without electricity.

AFP correspondents in Kathmandu reported that tremors were felt throughout the night.

“It has been a sleepless night, how can we sleep? It has been shaking all night. We are just praying that this will end and we can return home,” said Nina Shrestha, a 34-year-old banker who spent the night with hundreds of people on open ground in the capital’s Tudhikhel district.

As rescuers sifted through the huge mounds of rubble, the hospitals were overflowing with victims who suffered multiple fractures and trauma.

“We have treated many people since yesterday, majority children,” said Samir Acharya, a doctor at Nepal’s Annapurna Neurological Hospital.

“Most patients have head injuries or fractures. Two of our patients died, two are critical.” Acharya said medics were working out of a tent set up in a parking lot because of overflowing patients, while some patients were too scared to stay in the building.

Rescue team personnel carry an injured person towards a waiting rescue helicopter at Everest Base Camp today.

Families had grabbed whatever possessions they could muster and sought shelter on the streets, many of which had been split asunder.

Weather forecasters warned that rain was on the way, with dark clouds looming over Kathmandu and promising more misery for displaced survivors.

Snowfalls on Saturday had thwarted efforts to airlift survivors from Everest, where around 800 mountaineers were gathered at the start of the annual climbing season, cancelled last year after the sherpa deaths.

Google executive Dan Fredinburg was one of the climbers to have been confirmed as having been killed.

Experienced mountaineers said panic erupted at base camp, which has been “severely damaged”, while one described the avalanche as “huge”.

“Seventeen have been reported dead so far and 61 are injured,” said Tulsi Gautam of Nepal’s tourism department which issues permits to climb the world’s highest mountain.

“Those who are able are walking down. Others are being airlifted.”

Kannampilly said many of those stranded at the scene were walking down the mountain rather than risk being stuck for days.

George Foulsham, a Singapore-based marine biologist, described the moment that the disaster struck.

“I was outside, saw a white 50-storey building of white come at me. I ran and it just flattened me,” he told AFP.

“I tried to get up and it flattened me again. I couldn’t breathe, I thought I was dead. When I finally stood up, I couldn’t believe it passed me over and I was almost untouched.

“I saved for years to climb Everest. It feels like the mountain is saying it’s not meant to be climbed for now. Too much of a coincidence to see this twice in two years.” Nepal and the rest of the Himalayas are particularly prone to earthquakes because of the collision of the Indian and Eurasia plates.

An 6.8 magnitude quake hit eastern Nepal in August 1988 killing 721 people, and a magnitude 8.1 quake killed 10,700 people in Nepal and India in 1934.

Aussies safe

More than 200 Australians in Nepal are confirmed safe after the massive earthquake.

However, authorities are still trying to contact hundreds of others, with 549 Australians registered as travelling in Nepal. Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop says officials are working under challenging conditions to locate all those in the country.

The federal government has committed $5 million in assistance, half of which will go to Australian non-government organisations.

An Australian Crisis Response Team will travel to Nepal as soon as possible to assist in establishing the welfare of the Australians still unaccounted for after Saturday’s 7.8 magnitude earthquake.

“While there are reports of extensive loss of life, at this point there are no reports of Australian deaths,” Ms Bishop said in a statement on Sunday.

Worried relatives have inundated social media with pleas for help and information.

Twitter and Facebook pages are showing images of Australians in Nepal while many families have reported dozens of loved ones missing on The Red Cross’s Family Links website.

One is 24-year-old Sydney business owner Matthew Graves, who was travelling through Pokhara.

His brother, Mitch Graves, is at home in Sydney waiting for news while their parents are overseas in America.

“It’s a bit of a struggle trying to communicate to everyone. It is a waiting game at the moment,” he told AAP.

The younger brother of Australian actor Hugh Sheridan is also missing.

“Please. Anyone who is awake, please pray for my little brother Zachary who is on Mt Everest,” Mr Sheridan tweeted.

Deb Williams is still waiting for news about her Brisbane-based son Jai, who was due to be at Mount Everest base camp on Saturday. Mr Williams was trekking with his friend Ben Flanders.

After being reported as missing, Perth woman Ballantyne Paige Forder has been found safe. The 22-year-old contacted her family today after helping move the orphanage where she worked to a field.

Amanda-Sue Markham tweeted: “My baby sister is safe. Prayers answered as she and the orphanage moved to safety”.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has opened its emergency call unit and updated travel advice for Nepal, warning of disruptions to communication, transport and tourist infrastructure in the country.

Australians concerned for family and friends are asked to try to contact them directly before calling DFAT’s 24-hour consular emergency centre on (02) 6261-3305 or, within Australia, 1300 555 135.

Aid agencies are already sending teams to Nepal to help in the aftermath of the country’s deadliest earthquake in more than 80 years.

Oxfam Australia chief executive Helen Szoke says a group of disaster specialists from the UK is flying in with supplies. “People are gathered in their thousands in open spaces and are scared,” Dr Szoke said in a statement.

The head of World Vision Australia Tim Costello is flying to Nepal to assess the recovery effort.

He says there are already 200 Nepalese World Vision staff on the ground and its relief experts are being flown in from Bangladesh and India.

He called on governments to mobilise and collaborate in the relief effort.

Anxious wait for families of Australians

By 10am on Sunday, worried relatives and friends had listed 66 names on The Red Cross’s Family Links website.

Since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit on Saturday, families have been putting the names of missing loved ones on website.

The younger brother of Australian actor Hugh Sheridan is among the missing.

“Please. Anyone who is awake, please pray for my little brother Zachary who is on Mt Everest,” Mr Sheridan tweeted.

The families of two Queensland friends believed to be on a hike to the Mount Everest base camp are also desperate for any news of their whereabouts.

Ben Flanders and Jai Williams, both from the Brisbane area, were due to reach the camp on Saturday, according to Jai’s mother Deb Williams.

Ms Williams has pleaded for information from her son’s guide, Rahul Shrestha, on Facebook.

“Do you know if they made it, are they ok?” she wrote on Sunday morning.

“I am terrified I can’t get any information.”

The federal opposition has called on the Abbott government to offer every assistance towards the recovery effort in Nepal.

“Labor has asked the government for urgent advice about the safety of Australians reported to have been in the area at the time,” Opposition foreign spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek said in a statement today.

New Zealand says it stands ready to assist with financial and practical help, as authorities confirm that about 100 Kiwis in Nepal are safe and efforts to contact others continue.

Foreign aid agencies are already sending assistance to Nepal as the country grapples with the worst earthquake in more than 80 years.

Oxfam Australia chief executive Helen Szoke says a group of disaster specialists from the UK is flying in with supplies. “People are gathered in their thousands in open spaces and are scared, as there were several aftershocks,” Dr Szoke said in a statement.

Search for survivors

Tens of thousands of people were spending the night in the open under a chilly and thunderous sky after a powerful earthquake devastated Nepal on Saturday, killing nearly 1400, collapsing modern houses and ancient temples and triggering a landslide on Mount Everest.

Officials warned the death toll would rise as more reports came in from far-flung areas.

Inspector Yuvraj Khadka of Nepal’s national police force said that rescue effort was continuing through the night and the death toll had reached 1394 people.

The earthquake, which hit struck at 11.56am (4.11pm AEST), was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years.

It was strong enough to be felt all across the northern part of neighbouring India, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan, where a total of 50 people died.

As Nepal trembled, residents fled homes and buildings in panic. Walls tumbled, trees swayed, power lines came crashing down and large cracks opened up on streets and walls. Clouds of dust began to swirl all around.

Within hours of the quake, hospitals had filled up with hundreds of injured people. With organised relief and rescue lacking, many survivors were brought to hospitals by friends and relatives in motorised rickshaws, flatbed trucks and cars. Residents used their bare hands, crowbars and other tools to dig through rubble and rescue survivors.

More than two dozen aftershocks jolted the area after the first quake, which struck just before noon. At the time, Shrish Vaidya, who runs an advertising agency, was in his two-storey house outside the capital Kathmandu with his parents.

“It is hard to describe. The house was shaking like crazy. We ran out and it seemed like the road was heaving up and down,” Vaidya, 46, told The Associated Press. “I don’t remember anything like this before. Even my parents can’t remember anything this bad.”

Once the first shaking stopped, Vaidya thought his family could return indoors by evening. But the jolts kept coming, and they felt safer outdoors.

“It’s cold and windy so we are all sitting in the car listening to the news on FM radio,” he said. “The experts are saying it’s still not safe to go back inside. No one can predict how big the next aftershock will be.”

So the family ate dinner outside with the headlights of their car providing light. Vaidya was grateful his wife and 10-year-old son were on holiday in the U.S.

In his largely affluent neighbourhood of low-rise, sturdy homes in suburban Kathmandu the damage was relatively light. In other parts of the city where the buildings are older and poorly built people were not as lucky.

Forecasts called for rain and thunder showers later Saturday and Sunday and the temperatures were cold enough to make camping outside uncomfortable.

Thousands of people were spending the night at Tudikhel, a vast open ground in the middle of Kathmandu, just next to the old city that is lined with historic buildings and narrow lanes. Now it is in ruins.

People lay on plastic sheets or cardboard boxes, wrapped in blankets. Mothers kept their children warm; some lit fire with whatever wood they could find. Most were eating instant noodles and cookies.

Deepak Rauniar, a shop worker who was there with his friends, said: “We are too scared to go back to our apartment. It is surrounded closely by houses, most of them old. The houses could collapse while we are still sleeping.”

Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who was attending a summit in Jakarta, tried to rush back home but made it as far as Bangkok where his connecting flight to Kathmandu was cancelled because the capital’s international airport was shut down for commercial flights.

Indian air force planes were allowed to bring in 43 tons of relief material, including tents and foods, and nearly 200 rescuers, India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said. The planes were returning to New Delhi with Indian nationals who were stranded in Kathmandu. India’s state-run Air India announced that it would begin relief flights to the Nepalese capital Sunday.

Hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overcrowded, running out of room for storing dead bodies and running out of emergency supplies, the United Nations said in a statement.

“The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise,” U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon said. “It is clear that very many lives have been lost. There has also been significant damage to Nepal’s irreplaceable cultural heritage.”

While the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster were yet to be known, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world, and its rich Hindu culture. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, relies heavily on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.

A mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, said an avalanche swept the face of Mt. Everest after the earthquake, and government officials said at least 10 climbers were killed and 30 injured. Their nationalities were not immediately known.

Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, a Dane who was climbing the Everest with a Belgian, Jelle Veyt, said on his Facebook page that they were at Khumbu Icefall , a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow close to base camp at altitude 5,000 meters, when the earthquake hit.

“Right now, it is pretty chaotic and we try to help those injured,” Pedersen wrote in an email to Danish news agency Ritzau.

Norwegian climber Teodor Glomnes Johansen told a newspaper in Norway that people at base camp were working on saving lives.

“All those who are unharmed organise help with the rescue efforts. Men, women and Sherpas are working side by side. The job right now is to assist the doctors in the camp here,” Glomnes Johansen told Norway’s VG newspaper.

The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the quake at 7.8. It said the quake hit at 11:56am local time at Lamjung, about 80km northwest of Kathmandu. Its depth was only 11km, the largest shallow quake since the 8.2 temblor off the coast of Chile on April 1, 2014.

The shallower the quake the more destructive power it carries.

A magnitude 7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while an 8 magnitude quake can cause tremendous damage. This means Saturday’s quake - with the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 - was about 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.

The quake occurred at the boundary between the two pieces, or plates, of Earth’s crust, one of which supports India to the south and the other Eurasia to the north. The Indian Plate is moving at 45 millimetres a year under the Eurasian Plate, and this results in earthquakes once every 500 year on an average, said Marin Clark, a geophysicist at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

So the quake was “definitely not a surprise,” she said. Over millions of years, such quakes have led to the uplift of the Himalayas. Nepal suffered its worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.

The power of Saturday’s tremors brought down several buildings in the centre of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers.

Among them was the nine-story Dharahara Tower, one of Kathmandu’s landmarks built by Nepal’s royal rulers as a watchtower in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognised historical monument. It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath.

Hundreds of people buy tickets on weekends to go up to the viewing platform on the eighth story, but it was not clear how many were up there when the tower collapsed. Video footage showed people digging through the rubble of the tower, looking for survivors.

The Kathmandu Valley is listed as a World Heritage site and is a collection of seven locations around Nepal’s capital that reflect the country’s rich religious history. The Buddhist stupas, public squares and Hindu temples are some of the most well-known sites in Kathmandu, and now some of the most deeply mourned.

The head of the U.N. cultural agency, Irina Bokova, said in a statement that UNESCO was ready to help Nepal rebuild from “extensive damage, including to historic monuments and buildings of the Kathmandu Valley.”

Nepali journalist and author Shiwani Neupane tweeted: “The sadness is sinking in. We have lost our temples, our history, the places we grew up.”

Climbers caught in earthquake on Everest

An avalanche at Mount Everest base camp triggered by a massive earthquake killed at least 13 people, including foreign climbers, a Nepalese official said.

“We don’t have the details yet, but 10 have been reported dead so far, including foreign climbers,” Gyanendra Kumar Shrestha from Nepal’s tourism department told AFP.

AFP Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly said she was caught in the earthquake that ripped though large parts of the country.

“We got caught in an earthquake on Everest. We are both okay … snowing here so no choppers coming,” she said in an SMS on approach to base camp while on assignment.

Two experienced mountaineers reported that panic erupted at base camp which was full of climbing teams and had been “severely damaged”, while one said the quake triggered a “huge avalanche”.

“Running for life from my tent. Unhurt. Many many people up the mountain,” tweeted Romanian climber Alex Gavan who had been preparing to climb up nearby Lhotse, the world’s fourth highest mountain.

Another climber Daniel Mazur said his team was trapped at camp one higher up the mountain in the wake of the earthquake.

“A massive earthquake just hit Everest. Base camp has been severely damaged. Our team is caught in Camp 1. Please pray for everyone,” he also tweeted.

Everest was hit by an avalanche last year that killed 16 guides and triggered an unprecedented shutdown of the mountain.

About 700 climbers are in Solukhumbhu district that includes Everest, with 300 thought to be at base camp itself, deputy superintendent of police Chandra Dev Rai said.

“We are trying to reach them to see if they are safe, but the phones are not working,” he told AFP from Solukhumbhu town through which climbers pass en route to the mountain.

Hundreds die in Nepal quake

Powerful aftershocks have rocked Nepal, panicking survivors of a quake that killed more than 2350 and triggering fresh avalanches at Everest base camp, as rescuers dug through rubble in the devastated capital Kathmandu.

Terrified residents, many forced to camp out after Saturday’s quake reduced buildings to rubble, were jolted by this afternoon’s 6.7-magnitude aftershock that compounded the worst disaster to hit the impoverished Himalayan nation in more than 80 years.

interior Ministry spokesman Laxmi Dhakal says a total of 2352 people are confirmed dead across the country and 5838 people have been injured.

Officials in India said the toll there now stood at 60, while Chinese state media said 17 people had been killed in the Tibet region.

With scores of people still missing or seriously injured, the death toll is expected to climb further.

Hospitals were so stretched that medics had to set up tents outside to treat patients.

The historic nine-storey Dharahara tower, a major tourist attraction, was among the buildings brought down, with at least a dozen bodies recovered from the ruins of the 19th-century tower.

Offers of help poured in from around the world, with the United States and European Union announcing they were sending in disaster response teams and Australia giving $5 million in assistance, half of which will go to Australian non-government organisations .

India flew out its stranded citizens in military planes while a 62-strong Chinese rescue team arrived with sniffer dogs.

National police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam said the number known to have died in Nepal had risen to 1953 while 4629 people had been injured.

Officials in India said the toll there now stood at 53, mainly in the eastern state of Bihar, while Chinese state media said 17 people had been killed in the Tibet region.

Officials said 17 people were so far known to have died on Mount Everest where an avalanche triggered by the earthquake buried part of base camp.

It is the deadliest disaster in Everest’s history and comes almost exactly a year after an avalanche killed 16 sherpa guides.

AFP’s Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly, on an assignment at base camp, reported that six helicopters had managed to reach the mountain today after the weather improved overnight.

A stunning image captured by the agency’s South Asia photo chief Roberto Schmidt showed a massive cloud of snow and debris cascading onto base camp, burying scores of climbers and flattening tents.

“People being stretchered out as choppers land — half a dozen this morning,” Kannampilly said in a text message.

“Weather clear, some snowfall.” The country’s cellphone network was working only sporadically, while large parts of the capital were without electricity.

AFP correspondents in Kathmandu reported that tremors were felt throughout the night.

“It has been a sleepless night, how can we sleep? It has been shaking all night. We are just praying that this will end and we can return home,” said Nina Shrestha, a 34-year-old banker who spent the night with hundreds of people on open ground in the capital’s Tudhikhel district.

As rescuers sifted through the huge mounds of rubble, the hospitals were overflowing with victims who suffered multiple fractures and trauma.

“We have treated many people since yesterday, majority children,” said Samir Acharya, a doctor at Nepal’s Annapurna Neurological Hospital.

“Most patients have head injuries or fractures. Two of our patients died, two are critical.” Acharya said medics were working out of a tent set up in a parking lot because of overflowing patients, while some patients were too scared to stay in the building.

Rescue team personnel carry an injured person towards a waiting rescue helicopter at Everest Base Camp today.

Families had grabbed whatever possessions they could muster and sought shelter on the streets, many of which had been split asunder.

Weather forecasters warned that rain was on the way, with dark clouds looming over Kathmandu and promising more misery for displaced survivors.

Snowfalls on Saturday had thwarted efforts to airlift survivors from Everest, where around 800 mountaineers were gathered at the start of the annual climbing season, cancelled last year after the sherpa deaths.

Google executive Dan Fredinburg was one of the climbers to have been confirmed as having been killed.

Experienced mountaineers said panic erupted at base camp, which has been “severely damaged”, while one described the avalanche as “huge”.

“Seventeen have been reported dead so far and 61 are injured,” said Tulsi Gautam of Nepal’s tourism department which issues permits to climb the world’s highest mountain.

“Those who are able are walking down. Others are being airlifted.”

Kannampilly said many of those stranded at the scene were walking down the mountain rather than risk being stuck for days.

George Foulsham, a Singapore-based marine biologist, described the moment that the disaster struck.

“I was outside, saw a white 50-storey building of white come at me. I ran and it just flattened me,” he told AFP.

“I tried to get up and it flattened me again. I couldn’t breathe, I thought I was dead. When I finally stood up, I couldn’t believe it passed me over and I was almost untouched.

“I saved for years to climb Everest. It feels like the mountain is saying it’s not meant to be climbed for now. Too much of a coincidence to see this twice in two years.” Nepal and the rest of the Himalayas are particularly prone to earthquakes because of the collision of the Indian and Eurasia plates.

An 6.8 magnitude quake hit eastern Nepal in August 1988 killing 721 people, and a magnitude 8.1 quake killed 10,700 people in Nepal and India in 1934.

Aussies safe

More than 200 Australians in Nepal are confirmed safe after the massive earthquake.

However, authorities are still trying to contact hundreds of others, with 549 Australians registered as travelling in Nepal. Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop says officials are working under challenging conditions to locate all those in the country.

The federal government has committed $5 million in assistance, half of which will go to Australian non-government organisations.

An Australian Crisis Response Team will travel to Nepal as soon as possible to assist in establishing the welfare of the Australians still unaccounted for after Saturday’s 7.8 magnitude earthquake.

“While there are reports of extensive loss of life, at this point there are no reports of Australian deaths,” Ms Bishop said in a statement on Sunday.

Worried relatives have inundated social media with pleas for help and information.

Twitter and Facebook pages are showing images of Australians in Nepal while many families have reported dozens of loved ones missing on The Red Cross’s Family Links website.

One is 24-year-old Sydney business owner Matthew Graves, who was travelling through Pokhara.

His brother, Mitch Graves, is at home in Sydney waiting for news while their parents are overseas in America.

“It’s a bit of a struggle trying to communicate to everyone. It is a waiting game at the moment,” he told AAP.

The younger brother of Australian actor Hugh Sheridan is also missing.

“Please. Anyone who is awake, please pray for my little brother Zachary who is on Mt Everest,” Mr Sheridan tweeted.

Deb Williams is still waiting for news about her Brisbane-based son Jai, who was due to be at Mount Everest base camp on Saturday. Mr Williams was trekking with his friend Ben Flanders.

After being reported as missing, Perth woman Ballantyne Paige Forder has been found safe. The 22-year-old contacted her family today after helping move the orphanage where she worked to a field.

Amanda-Sue Markham tweeted: “My baby sister is safe. Prayers answered as she and the orphanage moved to safety”.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has opened its emergency call unit and updated travel advice for Nepal, warning of disruptions to communication, transport and tourist infrastructure in the country.

Australians concerned for family and friends are asked to try to contact them directly before calling DFAT’s 24-hour consular emergency centre on (02) 6261-3305 or, within Australia, 1300 555 135.

Aid agencies are already sending teams to Nepal to help in the aftermath of the country’s deadliest earthquake in more than 80 years.

Oxfam Australia chief executive Helen Szoke says a group of disaster specialists from the UK is flying in with supplies. “People are gathered in their thousands in open spaces and are scared,” Dr Szoke said in a statement.

The head of World Vision Australia Tim Costello is flying to Nepal to assess the recovery effort.

He says there are already 200 Nepalese World Vision staff on the ground and its relief experts are being flown in from Bangladesh and India.

He called on governments to mobilise and collaborate in the relief effort.

Anxious wait for families of Australians

By 10am on Sunday, worried relatives and friends had listed 66 names on The Red Cross’s Family Links website.

Since the 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit on Saturday, families have been putting the names of missing loved ones on website.

The younger brother of Australian actor Hugh Sheridan is among the missing.

“Please. Anyone who is awake, please pray for my little brother Zachary who is on Mt Everest,” Mr Sheridan tweeted.

The families of two Queensland friends believed to be on a hike to the Mount Everest base camp are also desperate for any news of their whereabouts.

Ben Flanders and Jai Williams, both from the Brisbane area, were due to reach the camp on Saturday, according to Jai’s mother Deb Williams.

Ms Williams has pleaded for information from her son’s guide, Rahul Shrestha, on Facebook.

“Do you know if they made it, are they ok?” she wrote on Sunday morning.

“I am terrified I can’t get any information.”

The federal opposition has called on the Abbott government to offer every assistance towards the recovery effort in Nepal.

“Labor has asked the government for urgent advice about the safety of Australians reported to have been in the area at the time,” Opposition foreign spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek said in a statement today.

New Zealand says it stands ready to assist with financial and practical help, as authorities confirm that about 100 Kiwis in Nepal are safe and efforts to contact others continue.

Foreign aid agencies are already sending assistance to Nepal as the country grapples with the worst earthquake in more than 80 years.

Oxfam Australia chief executive Helen Szoke says a group of disaster specialists from the UK is flying in with supplies. “People are gathered in their thousands in open spaces and are scared, as there were several aftershocks,” Dr Szoke said in a statement.

Search for survivors

Tens of thousands of people were spending the night in the open under a chilly and thunderous sky after a powerful earthquake devastated Nepal on Saturday, killing nearly 1400, collapsing modern houses and ancient temples and triggering a landslide on Mount Everest.

Officials warned the death toll would rise as more reports came in from far-flung areas.

Inspector Yuvraj Khadka of Nepal’s national police force said that rescue effort was continuing through the night and the death toll had reached 1394 people.

The earthquake, which hit struck at 11.56am (4.11pm AEST), was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years.

It was strong enough to be felt all across the northern part of neighbouring India, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan, where a total of 50 people died.

As Nepal trembled, residents fled homes and buildings in panic. Walls tumbled, trees swayed, power lines came crashing down and large cracks opened up on streets and walls. Clouds of dust began to swirl all around.

Within hours of the quake, hospitals had filled up with hundreds of injured people. With organised relief and rescue lacking, many survivors were brought to hospitals by friends and relatives in motorised rickshaws, flatbed trucks and cars. Residents used their bare hands, crowbars and other tools to dig through rubble and rescue survivors.

More than two dozen aftershocks jolted the area after the first quake, which struck just before noon. At the time, Shrish Vaidya, who runs an advertising agency, was in his two-storey house outside the capital Kathmandu with his parents.

“It is hard to describe. The house was shaking like crazy. We ran out and it seemed like the road was heaving up and down,” Vaidya, 46, told The Associated Press. “I don’t remember anything like this before. Even my parents can’t remember anything this bad.”

Once the first shaking stopped, Vaidya thought his family could return indoors by evening. But the jolts kept coming, and they felt safer outdoors.

“It’s cold and windy so we are all sitting in the car listening to the news on FM radio,” he said. “The experts are saying it’s still not safe to go back inside. No one can predict how big the next aftershock will be.”

So the family ate dinner outside with the headlights of their car providing light. Vaidya was grateful his wife and 10-year-old son were on holiday in the U.S.

In his largely affluent neighbourhood of low-rise, sturdy homes in suburban Kathmandu the damage was relatively light. In other parts of the city where the buildings are older and poorly built people were not as lucky.

Forecasts called for rain and thunder showers later Saturday and Sunday and the temperatures were cold enough to make camping outside uncomfortable.

Thousands of people were spending the night at Tudikhel, a vast open ground in the middle of Kathmandu, just next to the old city that is lined with historic buildings and narrow lanes. Now it is in ruins.

People lay on plastic sheets or cardboard boxes, wrapped in blankets. Mothers kept their children warm; some lit fire with whatever wood they could find. Most were eating instant noodles and cookies.

Deepak Rauniar, a shop worker who was there with his friends, said: “We are too scared to go back to our apartment. It is surrounded closely by houses, most of them old. The houses could collapse while we are still sleeping.”

Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who was attending a summit in Jakarta, tried to rush back home but made it as far as Bangkok where his connecting flight to Kathmandu was cancelled because the capital’s international airport was shut down for commercial flights.

Indian air force planes were allowed to bring in 43 tons of relief material, including tents and foods, and nearly 200 rescuers, India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said. The planes were returning to New Delhi with Indian nationals who were stranded in Kathmandu. India’s state-run Air India announced that it would begin relief flights to the Nepalese capital Sunday.

Hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overcrowded, running out of room for storing dead bodies and running out of emergency supplies, the United Nations said in a statement.

“The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise,” U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon said. “It is clear that very many lives have been lost. There has also been significant damage to Nepal’s irreplaceable cultural heritage.”

While the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster were yet to be known, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world, and its rich Hindu culture. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, relies heavily on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.

A mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, said an avalanche swept the face of Mt. Everest after the earthquake, and government officials said at least 10 climbers were killed and 30 injured. Their nationalities were not immediately known.

Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, a Dane who was climbing the Everest with a Belgian, Jelle Veyt, said on his Facebook page that they were at Khumbu Icefall , a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow close to base camp at altitude 5,000 meters, when the earthquake hit.

“Right now, it is pretty chaotic and we try to help those injured,” Pedersen wrote in an email to Danish news agency Ritzau.

Norwegian climber Teodor Glomnes Johansen told a newspaper in Norway that people at base camp were working on saving lives.

“All those who are unharmed organise help with the rescue efforts. Men, women and Sherpas are working side by side. The job right now is to assist the doctors in the camp here,” Glomnes Johansen told Norway’s VG newspaper.

The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the quake at 7.8. It said the quake hit at 11:56am local time at Lamjung, about 80km northwest of Kathmandu. Its depth was only 11km, the largest shallow quake since the 8.2 temblor off the coast of Chile on April 1, 2014.

The shallower the quake the more destructive power it carries.

A magnitude 7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while an 8 magnitude quake can cause tremendous damage. This means Saturday’s quake - with the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 - was about 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.

The quake occurred at the boundary between the two pieces, or plates, of Earth’s crust, one of which supports India to the south and the other Eurasia to the north. The Indian Plate is moving at 45 millimetres a year under the Eurasian Plate, and this results in earthquakes once every 500 year on an average, said Marin Clark, a geophysicist at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

So the quake was “definitely not a surprise,” she said. Over millions of years, such quakes have led to the uplift of the Himalayas. Nepal suffered its worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.

The power of Saturday’s tremors brought down several buildings in the centre of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers.

Among them was the nine-story Dharahara Tower, one of Kathmandu’s landmarks built by Nepal’s royal rulers as a watchtower in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognised historical monument. It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath.

Hundreds of people buy tickets on weekends to go up to the viewing platform on the eighth story, but it was not clear how many were up there when the tower collapsed. Video footage showed people digging through the rubble of the tower, looking for survivors.

The Kathmandu Valley is listed as a World Heritage site and is a collection of seven locations around Nepal’s capital that reflect the country’s rich religious history. The Buddhist stupas, public squares and Hindu temples are some of the most well-known sites in Kathmandu, and now some of the most deeply mourned.

The head of the U.N. cultural agency, Irina Bokova, said in a statement that UNESCO was ready to help Nepal rebuild from “extensive damage, including to historic monuments and buildings of the Kathmandu Valley.”

Nepali journalist and author Shiwani Neupane tweeted: “The sadness is sinking in. We have lost our temples, our history, the places we grew up.”

Climbers caught in earthquake on Everest

An avalanche at Mount Everest base camp triggered by a massive earthquake killed at least 13 people, including foreign climbers, a Nepalese official said.

“We don’t have the details yet, but 10 have been reported dead so far, including foreign climbers,” Gyanendra Kumar Shrestha from Nepal’s tourism department told AFP.

AFP Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly said she was caught in the earthquake that ripped though large parts of the country.

“We got caught in an earthquake on Everest. We are both okay … snowing here so no choppers coming,” she said in an SMS on approach to base camp while on assignment.

Two experienced mountaineers reported that panic erupted at base camp which was full of climbing teams and had been “severely damaged”, while one said the quake triggered a “huge avalanche”.

“Running for life from my tent. Unhurt. Many many people up the mountain,” tweeted Romanian climber Alex Gavan who had been preparing to climb up nearby Lhotse, the world’s fourth highest mountain.

Another climber Daniel Mazur said his team was trapped at camp one higher up the mountain in the wake of the earthquake.

“A massive earthquake just hit Everest. Base camp has been severely damaged. Our team is caught in Camp 1. Please pray for everyone,” he also tweeted.

Everest was hit by an avalanche last year that killed 16 guides and triggered an unprecedented shutdown of the mountain.

About 700 climbers are in Solukhumbhu district that includes Everest, with 300 thought to be at base camp itself, deputy superintendent of police Chandra Dev Rai said.

“We are trying to reach them to see if they are safe, but the phones are not working,” he told AFP from Solukhumbhu town through which climbers pass en route to the mountain.

KATHMANDU, Nepal

A magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit Nepal on Saturday, collapsing historic buildings in the capital, Kathmandu, fracturing highways and triggering avalanches on Mount Everest. By evening, authorities said, said, at least 1,457 people had died, including a Google manager from California who was climbing Everest.

Residents reported seeing trails of destruction - collapsed walls, broken windows and fallen telephone poles - as they drove through the capital. At nightfall, they described Kathmandu as a “tent city with supplies of food and water severely limited. Many residents were forced to sleep in the open air.

“We don’t want to go home now with so many aftershocks through the day, and even just now it is too risky to stay indoors,” said Sakila Gurng, a resident of the densely populated New Baneshwor neighborhood who was camping at a schoolground. “I hope it doesn’t rain.”

The city was in a state of “near total darkness” before 9:30 p.m., according to Kunda Dixit, editor of the Nepali Times.

The earthquake struck just before noon local time and was centered 48 miles northwest of Kathmandu, home to 1.4 million people.

It was most severely felt in the capital and the densely populated Kathmandu Valley, but it also shook several cities across northern India, and was felt as far away as Lahore, Pakistan; Lhasa,Tibet; and Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Officials said the quake occurred at a depth of only 7 miles, which is considered shallow in geological terms. The shallower the quake, the more destructive power it carries. Witnesses said the trembling and swaying of the earth went on for several minutes.

A magnitude 6.6 aftershock hit about an hour later, and at least 20 other aftershocks followed the huge quake, Nepal’s most powerful in eight decades.

“This quake was so big, ”said Prajana W. Pradham, who is helping coordinate the CARE relief agency’s emergency response. “We’ve been feeling tremors for four hours. I just felt another big jolt.”

Kathmandu’s airport was closed, television and Internet services were disrupted, and phone and electricity lines were down.

A number of historic structures were severely damaged or destroyed, including Patan Durbar Square. The area is one of three Durbar Squares in the Kathmandu Valley, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Dharahara Tower, a 200-foot-tall structure built in 1832, collapsed, trapping some people underneath.

Video from the scene showed people digging through the rubble of the collapsed tower, looking for survivors.

As the quake intensified, residents ran out of homes and buildings in panic. Clouds of dust began to swirl around them. Large cracks opened up on streets and walls.

Nepal Republic Media, a private news service in the country, said an Indian Air Force C-130 plane carrying 40 rescue and medical personnel and 3 tons of supplies arrived in Kathmandu.

Three other aircraft, including two C-17s, were sent from India, Indian Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh said on Indian television. One was carrying a mobile hospital.

“There has been heavy damage in and around Kathmandu,” Singh said, adding that Nepal’s government asked for tents, blankets and teams to help search for survivors. On Sunday, he said, 10 helicopters would be sent for local rescues, medical airlift and food distribution.

Nepal, a country of 30 million people, is bordered by India to the southwest and China to the northeast.

Many structures in Nepal are made of unreinforced brick or rubble and field stone, and scores of people were injured in the quake by falling bricks.

The quake - with the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 - was about 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010. A magnitude 7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage. A magnitude 8 quake can cause tremendous damage.

In January 1934, a magnitude 8.2 quake struck Nepal, killing an estimated 10,000 people in Nepal and more than 7,000 in India. Much of Kathmandu was destroyed in that quake.

Though the extent of the damage and the scale Saturday’s quake are yet to be ascertained, it will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, depends heavily on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.

Javier Camacho Gimenez, a mountaineer and photographer who was at a base camp of Everest to attempt the ascent to the summit of Lhotse, said that avalanches had buried some camps, including ones with Chinese and Japanese climbers.

He estimated that eight people had died and 40 were injured. “The situation in the Everest base camp is now chaos,” he told the Spanish news agency Efe. “Helicopters can not access the area due to bad weather,” he said.

Among the dead on Everest was Dan Fredinburg of California, , a Google X project manager, the mountaineering company Jagged Globe wrote in a message from the camp where two other members of the team were being treated for injuries suffered in the avalanche. Fredinburg’s sister Megan confirmed in a post on his Instagram account that he was dead.

A powerful earthquake — the country's worst in 80 years — rocked mountainous Nepal on Saturday, killing more than 1,800 people and leveling buildings and centuries-old temples. Dozens if not hundreds remained trapped under mounds of rubble.

Hospitals in the capital of Katmandu were so crowded that many of the injured were treated outside in the open, according to local media. The magnitude-7.8 quake, which shook a wide swath of northern India, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan, also triggered avalanches in the Himalayas, killing at least 10 people on Mount Everest.

Nepal police said at least 1,865 people were killed. Given the scale of the destruction, the death toll was expected to rise. An emergency Cabinet meeting designated 29 districts as crisis zones, the Home Affairs Ministry said.

Tens of thousands of people, fearful of aftershocks bringing down more buildings, gathered outside during the night.

""My entire neighborhood is still in shock,"" said Chiranjibi Gurung in Katmandu. ""My children who were inside the houses at the time of the earthquake are scared to go inside now even at this time of the night.""

Around 180 bodies were pulled from the ruins of the nine-story Dharhara Tower in the center of the capital, China's official Xinhua News Agency reports. It said about 200 were feared trapped in the rubble of the tower in the city's historic Basantapur Durbar Square.

""We had heard the earthquake stories from our ancestors and how I remember my grandparents telling me about the devastation of the 1934 earthquake and how it uprooted the Dharahara Tower then,"" said Sabita Lal of Katmandu. ""I saw the same thing happen today to the tower. It was a massive one.""

Another Katmandu resident, Deepen Bista, whose house was damaged, said the big jolt ""was longer than we had experienced before, it lasted a little more than a minute."" The downtown area of the capital — with old houses and narrow lanes — was hardest hit, he said.

City hospitals were quickly overwhelmed. Dozens were gathered in the parking lot of Norvic International Hospital, where thin mattresses were spread on the ground for patients rushed outside, some wearing hospital pajamas. A woman with a bandage on her head sat in a set of chairs pulled from the hospital waiting room. Doctors and nurses had hooked up some patients to IV drips in the parking lot, or were giving people oxygen.

The quake struck before noon local time about 50 miles northwest of Katmandu in an area that the U.S. Geological Survey calls one of the most seismically hazardous regions on Earth. It is at the spot where the India plate collides with the Eurasia plate in a process that created the towering Himalayas.

The quake, which was felt as far away as Lahore in Pakistan, Lhasa in Tibet, and Dhaka, Bangladesh, was followed by about 15 aftershocks, including one registered at a magnitude of 6.6. At least 34 were killed in India, 12 in Tibet and two in Bangladesh. Two Chinese citizens died on the Nepal-China border.

Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat said on Twitter that the quake had destroyed about 90% of about 1,000 homes and huts in the Laprak and Barpak villages near the epicenter.

The humanitarian aid group Oxfam said it was sending a team of technical experts from Britain to provide clean water, sanitation and emergency food supplies. ""Communication is currently very difficult,"" said Cecilia Keizer, Oxfam country director in Nepal. ""Telephone lines are down, and the electricity has been cut off, making charging mobile phones difficult. The water is also cut off.""

Keizer said the quake had destroyed many of Katmandu's old houses and that at least one large apartment block had collapsed. ""People are gathered in the thousands in open spaces and are scared, as there have been several aftershocks,"" she said.

In Winchester, Va., Kriti Hada, a 20-year-old nursing student from Nepal who is attending Shenandoah University, said her sister in Nepal managed to get through by phone.

Although she, her mother and another sister were unhurt, they were frightened by the intensity and duration of the aftershocks, which are continuing, Hada told USA TODAY.

Hada said her relatives, like hundreds of others who survived the initial quake, were remaining outside until the seismic activity ceases. ""We have very limited open spaces and they are surrounded by tall buildings that are also fragile,"" Hada said.

Numerous countries around the world pledged immediate aid and supplies. The U.S. Mission in Nepal released an initial $1 million for immediate assistance. The embassy also said a U.S. search-and-rescue team is preparing to fly to Nepal. In addition, the U.S. Agency for International Development was sending a disaster assistance response team. India, Pakistan, China, France and Britain also said they would assist in the relief effort.

Within hours, an Indian Air Force C-130 landed at at Katmandu's airport with 39 disaster relief workers and 3.5 metric tons of supplies, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.

Several buildings collapsed in the center of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers. Among them was the Dharahara Tower, one of Katmandu's landmarks built by Nepal's royal rulers in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognized historical monument. It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath. The Katmandu Valley is densely populated with nearly 2.5 million people, and the quality of buildings is often poor.

Dhany Osman, an editor with The Straits Times of Singapore said he was at Katmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport when the quake struck.

""As bits of the ceiling began to fall, passengers who were waiting for their flights began to panic and started running out of the terminal, with some tripping over each other,"" he wrote. ""Despite the nearest exit door being just 10 (yards) away, a group of Nepali men smashed open a glass panel and climbed out of it. I tried telling people around me to calm down but they kept shoving each other to get out.""

Although the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster are yet to be ascertained, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, is heavily dependent on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain-climbing.

Nepal quake: Hundreds dead, Everest shaken

A Swedish woman, Jenny Adhikari, who lives in Nepal, told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that she was riding a bus in the town of Melamchi when the earth began to move.

""A huge stone crashed only about 20 (yards) from the bus,"" she was quoted as saying. ""All the houses around me have tumbled down. I think there are lot of people who have died,"" she told the newspaper by telephone. Melamchi is about 30 miles northeast of Kathmandu.

Although located on a major plate boundary with a history of large- to great-sized earthquakes, large earthquakes in this area are rare in the documented historical era, the USGS reports. Over the past century, just four events of magnitude 6.0 or larger have occurred within about 150 miles of Saturday's earthquake.

An earthquake's power increases by 10 times with each increase in the number of its scale. This means Saturday's earthquake — the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 — was 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.

An avalanche swept the face of Mt Everest after the massive earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday injuring dozens of people and killing at least 718.

The avalanche apparently struck between the Khumbu Icefall, a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow, and the base camp where most climbing expeditions are, said Ang Tshering of the Nepal Mountaineering Association.

Tshering said details were unclear because communication between the base camp and the rest of the Everest region was intermittent.

Nepal's Home Ministry said that the 30 people who were injured were at the base camp.

At least 79 people are dead after a powerful, 7.9-magnitude earthquake shook Nepal's capital and the densely populated Kathmandu Valley today.

The quake collapsed houses, levelled centuries-old temples and cut open roads in the worst tremor in the Himalayan nation in over 80 years.

Nepal's Home Ministry says at least 71 people killed in the earthquake.

Dozens of people with injuries were being brought to the main hospital in central Kathmandu.

The earthquake also shook several cities across northern India, and was felt as far away as Lahore in Pakistan and Lhasa in Tibet, 550km east of Kathmandu. The epicenter was 80km northwest of Kathmandu.

Pushpa Das, a labourer, ran from the house when the first quake struck but could not escape a collapsing wall that injured his arm.

""It was very scary. The earth was moving ... I am waiting for treatment but the (hospital) staff is overwhelmed,"" he said, gingerly holding his right arm with his left hand. As he spoke dozens of more people showed up with injuries, mostly from falling bricks.

Several buildings collapsed in the center of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers, said resident Prachanda Sual. Among them was the Dharahara Tower, one of Kathmandu's landmarks built by Nepal's royal rulers in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognised historical monument. It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath.

Old Kathmandu city is a warren of tightly packed, narrow lanes with poorly constructed homes piled on top of each other.

Sual said he saw people running through the streets in panic. Ambulance sirens blared and government helicopters hovered overhead.

National radio warned people to stay outdoors and maintain calm because more aftershocks were feared. A 6.6-magnitude aftershock hit about an hour after the initial quake. But smaller aftershocks continued to arrive every few minutes and residents reported of the ground feeling unstable.

Dozens of people were gathered in the parking lot of Kathmandu's Norvic International Hospital, where thin mattresses had been spread on the ground for patients rushed outside, some patients wearing hospital pajamas, while doctors and nurses were treating people. A woman with a bandage on her head sat in a set of chairs pulled from the hospital waiting room.

Doctors and nurses had hooked up some patients to IV drops in the parking lot, or were giving people oxygen.

Nepal's Information Minister Minendra Rijal told India's NDTV station that there are reports of damage in and around Kathmandu but no immediate word on casualties. He said rescue teams were on the scene.

The Kathmandu Valley is densely populated with nearly 2.5 million people, and the quality of buildings is often poor.

An Associated Press reporter in Kathmandu said a wall in his compound collapsed and there was damage to nearby buildings.

A Swedish woman, Jenny Adhikari, who lives in Nepal, told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that she was riding a bus in the town of Melamchi when the earth began to move.

""A huge stone crashed only about 20 meters (yards) from the bus,"" she was quoted as saying. ""All the houses around me have tumbled down. I think there are lot of people who have died,"" she told the newspaper by telephone. Melamchi is about 45km northeast of Kathmandu.

The US Geological Survey revised the magnitude from 7.5 to 7.9 and said the quake hit at 11.56am local time (7.11pm NZT) at Lamjung a shallow depth of 11km. An earthquake's magnitude increases by 10 times with each increase in the number. A magnitude-7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while an 8 magnitude quake can cause tremendous damage.

Mohammad Shahab, a resident from Lahore, Pakistan, said he was sitting in his office when the earthquake rocked the city near the border with India.

The sustained quake also was felt in India's capital of New Delhi. AP reporters in Indian cities of Lucknow in the north and Patna in the east also reported strong tremors.

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a meeting of top government officials to review the damage and disaster preparedness in parts of India that felt strong tremors. The Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Sikkim, which share a border with Nepal, have reported building damage. There have also been reports of damage in the northeastern state of Assam.

Nepal suffered its worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.

The sustained quake also was felt in India's capital of New Delhi. AP reporters in Indian cities of Lucknow in the north and Patna in the east also reported strong tremors.

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a meeting of top government officials to review the damage and disaster preparedness in parts of India that felt strong tremors.

The Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Sikkim, which share a border with Nepal, have reported building damage. There have also been reports of damage in the northeastern state of Assam. Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif offered ""all possible help"" that Nepal may need.

The avalanche struck between the Khumbu Icefall, a notoriously treacherous rugged area of collapsed ice and snow, and the base camp where most climbing expeditions are, said Ang Tshering of the Nepal Mountaineering Association.

An official with Nepal's mountaineering department, Gyanendra Shretha, said the bodies of eight people had been recovered and an unknown number remain missing or injured.

The world's highest mountain is scaled by hundreds every year who brave extreme weather, a hostile terrain and unpredictable avalanches, one of which killed 16 Sherpa guides almost exactly a year ago.

Nepal's Home Ministry had earlier said that 30 people were injured at the base camp, while other climbers gave unconfirmed reports of more avalanches elsewhere on the mountain.

""We are starting to receive the injured, the most severe of them with many fractures, he was blown away by the avalanche and broke both legs. For the camps closer to where the avalanche hit, our Sherpas believe that a lot of people may have been buried in their tents,"" Danish climber Carsten Lillelund Pedersen wrote on Facebook. He and his Belgian companion, Jelle Veyt, were at the Khumbu Icefall, close to the base camp at an altitude of 5,000 meters (16,500 feet) when the earthquake hit.

He said that a steady flow of people were fleeing the base camp for more secure areas down the mountain.

Local reports in China said an amateur team encountered an avalanche on the north slope of the mountains at an elevation of more than 7,000 meters (22,965feet) and safely retreated to a camp at a lower elevation.

Thomas Frese Carlsen, a Danish schoolteacher who was in Nepal with 12 students from Denmark, said that rumors of another quake caused many to sleep out in the open.

""We will sleep outside tonight, on the lawn,"" he told Denmark's TV2 channel. He described the quake as ""freakin' wild.""

Climber Robin Trygg told the Swedish news agency TT his Sherpa guides had been in radio contact with other guides on Everest and that they reported an avalanche there hitting as many as 80 people.

""We were sitting in the tent and drinking tea when the earth, all of a sudden, began shaking. We didn't understand what happened,"" he told the news agency by telephone.

Another Swedish climber, Jenny Adhikari, was riding a bus in the town of Melamchi when she said she felt earth moving.

""All the houses around me have tumbled down. I think there are lot of people who have died,"" she told he Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet. ""A huge stone crashed only 20 meters from the bus.""

A powerful earthquake — the country's worst in 80 years — rocked mountainous Nepal on Saturday, killing more than 1,800 people and leveling buildings and centuries-old temples. Dozens if not hundreds remained trapped under mounds of rubble.

Hospitals in the capital of Katmandu were so crowded that many of the injured were treated outside in the open, according to local media. The magnitude-7.8 quake, which shook a wide swath of northern India, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan, also triggered avalanches in the Himalayas, killing at least 10 people on Mount Everest.

Nepal police said at least 1,865 people were killed. Given the scale of the destruction, the death toll was expected to rise. An emergency Cabinet meeting designated 29 districts as crisis zones, the Home Affairs Ministry said.

Tens of thousands of people, fearful of aftershocks bringing down more buildings, gathered outside during the night.

""My entire neighborhood is still in shock,"" said Chiranjibi Gurung in Katmandu. ""My children who were inside the houses at the time of the earthquake are scared to go inside now even at this time of the night.""

Around 180 bodies were pulled from the ruins of the nine-story Dharhara Tower in the center of the capital, China's official Xinhua News Agency reports. It said about 200 were feared trapped in the rubble of the tower in the city's historic Basantapur Durbar Square.

""We had heard the earthquake stories from our ancestors and how I remember my grandparents telling me about the devastation of the 1934 earthquake and how it uprooted the Dharahara Tower then,"" said Sabita Lal of Katmandu. ""I saw the same thing happen today to the tower. It was a massive one.""

Another Katmandu resident, Deepen Bista, whose house was damaged, said the big jolt ""was longer than we had experienced before, it lasted a little more than a minute."" The downtown area of the capital — with old houses and narrow lanes — was hardest hit, he said.

City hospitals were quickly overwhelmed. Dozens were gathered in the parking lot of Norvic International Hospital, where thin mattresses were spread on the ground for patients rushed outside, some wearing hospital pajamas. A woman with a bandage on her head sat in a set of chairs pulled from the hospital waiting room. Doctors and nurses had hooked up some patients to IV drips in the parking lot, or were giving people oxygen.

The quake struck before noon local time about 50 miles northwest of Katmandu in an area that the U.S. Geological Survey calls one of the most seismically hazardous regions on Earth. It is at the spot where the India plate collides with the Eurasia plate in a process that created the towering Himalayas.

The quake, which was felt as far away as Lahore in Pakistan, Lhasa in Tibet, and Dhaka, Bangladesh, was followed by about 15 aftershocks, including one registered at a magnitude of 6.6. At least 34 were killed in India, 12 in Tibet and two in Bangladesh. Two Chinese citizens died on the Nepal-China border.

Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat said on Twitter that the quake had destroyed about 90% of about 1,000 homes and huts in the Laprak and Barpak villages near the epicenter.

The humanitarian aid group Oxfam said it was sending a team of technical experts from Britain to provide clean water, sanitation and emergency food supplies. ""Communication is currently very difficult,"" said Cecilia Keizer, Oxfam country director in Nepal. ""Telephone lines are down, and the electricity has been cut off, making charging mobile phones difficult. The water is also cut off.""

Keizer said the quake had destroyed many of Katmandu's old houses and that at least one large apartment block had collapsed. ""People are gathered in the thousands in open spaces and are scared, as there have been several aftershocks,"" she said.

In Winchester, Va., Kriti Hada, a 20-year-old nursing student from Nepal who is attending Shenandoah University, said her sister in Nepal managed to get through by phone.

Although she, her mother and another sister were unhurt, they were frightened by the intensity and duration of the aftershocks, which are continuing, Hada told USA TODAY.

Hada said her relatives, like hundreds of others who survived the initial quake, were remaining outside until the seismic activity ceases. ""We have very limited open spaces and they are surrounded by tall buildings that are also fragile,"" Hada said.

Numerous countries around the world pledged immediate aid and supplies. The U.S. Mission in Nepal released an initial $1 million for immediate assistance. The embassy also said a U.S. search-and-rescue team is preparing to fly to Nepal. In addition, the U.S. Agency for International Development was sending a disaster assistance response team. India, Pakistan, China, France and Britain also said they would assist in the relief effort.

Within hours, an Indian Air Force C-130 landed at at Katmandu's airport with 39 disaster relief workers and 3.5 metric tons of supplies, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.

I tried telling people around me to calm down but they kept shoving each other to get out.""

Although the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster are yet to be ascertained, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, is heavily dependent on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain-climbing.

A Swedish woman, Jenny Adhikari, who lives in Nepal, told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that she was riding a bus in the town of Melamchi when the earth began to move.

""A huge stone crashed only about 20 (yards) from the bus,"" she was quoted as saying. ""All the houses around me have tumbled down. I think there are lot of people who have died,"" she told the newspaper by telephone. Melamchi is about 30 miles northeast of Kathmandu.

Although located on a major plate boundary with a history of large- to great-sized earthquakes, large earthquakes in this area are rare in the documented historical era, the USGS reports. Over the past century, just four events of magnitude 6.0 or larger have occurred within about 150 miles of Saturday's earthquake.

An earthquake's power increases by 10 times with each increase in the number of its scale. This means Saturday's earthquake — the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 — was 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.

Volunteers help with rescue work at the site of a building that collapsed after an earthquake in Kathmandu, Nepal, Saturday, April 25, 2015. A strong magnitude-7.9 earthquake shook Nepal's capital and the densely populated Kathmandu Valley before noon Saturday, causing extensive damage with toppled walls and collapsed buildings, officials said. (AP Photo/ Niranjan Shrestha) Tens of thousands of people were spending the night in the open under a chilly and thunderous sky after a powerful earthquake devastated Nepal on Saturday, killing nearly 1,400, collapsing modern houses and ancient temples and triggering a landslide on Mount Everest. Officials warned the death toll would rise as more reports came in from far-flung areas.

Inspector Yuvraj Khadka of Nepal's national police force said that rescue effort was continuing through the night and the death toll had reached 1,394 people. The magnitude 7.8 earthquake, which originated outside the capital Kathmandu, was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years. It strong enough to be felt all across the northern part of neighboring India, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan, where a total of 50 people died.

As Nepal trembled, residents fled homes and buildings in panic. Walls tumbled, trees swayed, power lines came crashing down and large cracks opened up on streets and walls. Clouds of dust began to swirl all around.

Within hours of the quake, hospitals had filled up with hundreds of injured people. With organized relief and rescue lacking, many survivors were brought to hospitals by friends and relatives in motorized rickshaws, flatbed trucks and cars. Residents used their bare hands, crowbars and other tools to dig through rubble and rescue survivors.

More than two dozen aftershocks jolted the area after the first quake, which struck just before noon. At the time, Shrish Vaidya, who runs an advertising agency, was in his two-story house outside the capital Kathmandu with his parents.

""It is hard to describe. The house was shaking like crazy. We ran out and it seemed like the road was heaving up and down,"" Vaidya, 46, told The Associated Press. ""I don't remember anything like this before. Even my parents can't remember anything this bad.""

Once the first shaking stopped, Vaidya thought his family could return indoors by evening. But the jolts kept coming, and they felt safer outdoors.

""It's cold and windy so we are all sitting in the car listening to the news on FM radio,"" he said. ""The experts are saying it's still not safe to go back inside. No one can predict how big the next aftershock will be.""

So the family ate dinner outside with the headlights of their car providing light. Vaidya was grateful his wife and 10-year-old son were on holiday in the U.S.

In his largely affluent neighborhood of low-rise, sturdy homes in suburban Kathmandu the damage was relatively light. In other parts of the city where the buildings are older and poorly built people were not as lucky.

Forecasts called for rain and thunder showers later Saturday and Sunday and the temperatures were in the mid-50s (14 Celsius), cold enough to make camping outside uncomfortable.

Thousands of people were spending the night at Tudikhel, a vast open ground in the middle of Kathmandu, just next to the old city that is lined with historic buildings and narrow lanes. Now it is in ruins.

People lay on plastic sheets or cardboard boxes, wrapped in blankets. Mothers kept their children warm; some lit fire with whatever wood they could find. Most were eating instant noodles and cookies.

Deepak Rauniar, a shop worker who was there with his friends, said: ""We are too scared to go back to our apartment. It is surrounded closely by houses, most of them old. The houses could collapse while we are still sleeping.""

Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who was attending a summit in Jakarta, tried to rush back home but made it as far as Bangkok where his connecting flight to Kathmandu was canceled because the capital's international airport was shut down for commercial flights.

Indian Air Force planes were allowed to bring in 43 tons of relief material, including tents and foods, and nearly 200 rescuers, India's External Affairs Ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said. The planes were returning to New Delhi with Indian nationals who were stranded in Kathmandu. India's state-run Air India announced that it would begin relief flights to the Nepalese capital Sunday.

Hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overcrowded, running out of room for storing dead bodies and running out of emergency supplies, the United Nations said in a statement.

""The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise,"" U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon said. ""It is clear that very many lives have been lost. There has also been significant damage to Nepal's irreplaceable cultural heritage.""

While the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster were yet to be known, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world, and its rich Hindu culture. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, relies heavily on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.

A mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, said an avalanche swept the face of Mt. Everest after the earthquake, and government officials said at least 10 climbers were killed and 30 injured. Their nationalities were not immediately known.

Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, a Dane who was climbing the Everest with a Belgian, Jelle Veyt, said on his Facebook page that they were at Khumbu Icefall , a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow close to base camp at altitude 5,000 meters (16,500 feet), when the earthquake hit.

""Right now, it is pretty chaotic and we try to help those injured,"" Pedersen wrote in an email to Danish news agency Ritzau.

Norwegian climber Teodor Glomnes Johansen told a newspaper in Norway that people at base camp were working on saving lives.

""All those who are unharmed organize help with the rescue efforts. Men, women and Sherpas are working side by side. The job right now is to assist the doctors in the camp here,"" Glomnes Johansen told Norway's VG newspaper.

The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the quake at 7.8. It said the quake hit at 11:56 a.m. local time (0611 GMT) at Lamjung, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu. Its depth was only 11 kilometers (7 miles), the largest shallow quake since the 8.2 temblor off the coast of Chile on April 1, 2014.

The shallower the quake the more destructive power it carries.

A magnitude 7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while an 8 magnitude quake can cause tremendous damage. This means Saturday's quake - with the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 - was about 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.

The quake occurred at the boundary between the two pieces, or plates, of Earth's crust, one of which supports India to the south and the other Eurasia to the north. The Indian plate is moving at 45 millimeters (1.7 inches) a year under the Eurasian plate, and this results in earthquakes once every 500 year on an average, said Marin Clark, a geophysicist at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

So the quake was ""definitely not a surprise,"" she said. Over millions of years, such quakes have led to the uplift of the Himalayas. Nepal suffered its worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.

The power of Saturday's tremors brought down several buildings in the center of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers.

Among them was the nine-story Dharahara Tower, one of Kathmandu's landmarks built by Nepal's royal rulers as a watchtower in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognized historical monument. It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath.

Hundreds of people buy tickets on weekends to go up to the viewing platform on the eighth story, but it was not clear how many were up there when the tower collapsed. Video footage showed people digging through the rubble of the tower, looking for survivors.

The Kathmandu Valley is listed as a World Heritage site and is a collection of seven locations around Nepal's capital that reflect the country's rich religious history. The Buddhist stupas, public squares and Hindu temples are some of the most well-known sites in Kathmandu, and now some of the most deeply mourned.

The head of the U.N. cultural agency, Irina Bokova, said in a statement that UNESCO was ready to help Nepal rebuild from ""extensive damage, including to historic monuments and buildings of the Kathmandu Valley.""

Tens of thousands of people prepared to spend the night in the open under a chilly and thundery sky after a powerful earthquake shook Nepal on Saturday, killing over a thousand people, collapsing modern houses and centuries-old temples, and triggering a landslide on the slopes of Mount Everest. Officials said the death toll will rise as more reports from far-flung areas come in.



The magnitude 7.8 earthquake, which originated outside the capital Kathmandu, was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years. It was so powerful that it was felt all across the northern part of neighboring India, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan where a total of 50 people died, whereas the death toll passed 2,000 in Nepal.



Several buildings collapsed in the center of the capital, including centuries-old temples, said resident Prachanda Sual.



He said he saw people running through the streets in panic. Ambulance sirens blared and government helicopters hovered overhead.



The earthquake in Nepal has killed 1,457, the Nepalese Army, Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat wrote on his Twitter account.



The quake measuring 7.9 is the strongest to hit the country in 81 years.







The quake also triggered an avalanche in Nepal and buried a part of the base camp for climbers bound for Mount Everest, killing at least eight people, Nepal's tourism ministry said.



""The toll could go up, it may include foreigners as well as sherpas,"" tourism official Gyanendra Shrestha said.



Romanian climber Alex Gavan had before said on his Twitter that there had been a ""huge avalanche"" and ""many, many"" people were up on the mountain.



""Running for life from my tent,"" Gavan said. ""Everest base camp huge earthquake then huge avalanche.""

People walk past a collapsed bullding in Nepal's capital Kathmandu after an earthquake struck on April 25, 2015

Countries and international aid groups rushed to respond Saturday to a massive earthquake in Nepal that claimed more than 1,000 lives as aftershocks and severed communications hampered rescue efforts.

""We do not yet know the scope of the damage, but this could be one of the deadliest and most devastating earthquakes since the 1934 tremor which devastated Nepal and Bihar,"" said Jagan Chapagain, Asia/Pacific director of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

The United States and the European Union were among those to pledge assistance to the government of Nepal, as messages of support poured in from world leaders including China's Xi Jinping, France's Francois Hollande, Germany's Angela Merkel and Russia's Vladimir Putin.

The IFRC said it was extremely concerned about the fate of rural villages close to the epicentre of the quake, some 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the capital Kathmandu.

""Roads have been damaged or blocked by landslides and communication lines are down preventing us from reaching local Red Cross branches to get accurate information,"" said Chapagain in a statement.

""We anticipate that there will be considerable destruction and loss of life.""

Other aid organisations responding to the emergency also struggled to assess the needs with communications cut off around the Himalayan nation.

""Communication is currently very difficult. Telephone lines are down and the electricity has been cut off making charging mobile phones difficult,"" said Cecilia Keizer, Oxfam country director in Nepal.

""People are gathered in their thousands in open spaces and are scared as there have been several aftershocks,"" she added.

French aid group Action Against Hunger (ACF) said in a statement its teams in Nepal ""were on their way to the affected areas to assess the damage and the needs"".

- 'Heartfelt sympathies' -

Nations around world have reacted to the deadly 7.8 magnitude quake that rocked Nepal.

The United States is sending a disaster response team and has authorised an initial $1 million in aid to address immediate needs, the US Agency for International Development said.

Secretary of State John Kerry said the US was working closely with the government of Nepal to provide assistance.

""To the people in Nepal and the region affected by this tragedy we send our heartfelt sympathies,"" he said.

""The United States stands with you during this difficult time.""

The European Union also said its humanitarian experts were heading to the crisis areas.

""The full extent of the casualties and damage is still unknown but reports indicate they will likely be high, both in terms of loss of life, injuries and damage to cultural heritage,"" an EU statement said.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her condolences to Nepali Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and said the government stood ready to help, her office said in a statement. Merkel was ""shaken by the extent of the catastrophe and the high number of victims,"" it added.

Britain and Spain also pledged support and assistance, with Norway promising to provide 30 million krone ($3.9 million, 3.5 million euros) in humanitarian aid.

British Prime Minister David Cameron said the earthquake was ""shocking news"" and vowed his country, which swiftly sent a team of humanitarian experts to Nepal, ""will do all we can to help those caught up in it.""

Israel also said it was sending an aid delegation to Nepal, including a team of paramedics and doctors.

Charity Christian Aid launched an appeal for funds and said it was working with partner agencies to reach the worst hit areas.

""It's clear from what has emerged so far that there is an urgent need for emergency shelters, food and clean drinking water, warm clothing blankets and hygiene kits,"" said the group's regional emergency manager Ram Kishan in a statement.

The UK has deployed a team of humanitarian experts to Nepal after a devastating earthquake ripped through the country, killing more than 1,000 people.

The eight-strong team will provide urgent humanitarian support for people affected by the disaster, International Development Secretary Justine Greening has said.

Disaster response specialists, including experts in search and rescue will travel to Nepal overnight and begin work assessing the scale of damage, and helping local authorities to direct the response.

Ms Greening said: ""My thoughts are with the people of Nepal, in particular all those who have lost loved ones. The absolute priority must be to reach people who are trapped and injured, and provide shelter and protection to those who have lost their homes.

""Nepal needs our urgent humanitarian assistance. That is why we have rapidly deployed a team of humanitarian experts who will immediately begin work assessing the damage and helping the Nepalese authorities respond to this devastating earthquake.""

The announcement comes after Prime Minister David Cameron earlier tweeted that the UK would do everything it could to help.

He posted: ""Shocking news about the earthquake in Nepal - the UK will do all we can to help those caught up in it.""

The majority of fatalities were reported in Nepal, with deaths also being confirmed in India, Tibet, Bangladesh and the Nepal-China border.

The 7.8 magnitude quake struck just before midday sending tremors through the Kathmandu Valley and the nearby city of Pokhara.

Labour leader Ed Miliband also expressed his sympathy for all those involved, tweeting: ""The awful scenes in Nepal are heartbreaking. My thoughts go out to the people affected, and to those caring for survivors.""

Tanya Barron, CEO of Plan International UK, who is in eastern Nepal on a scheduled visit, said she was on the top floor of a building when it started to ""shake violently"".

Oxfam is also lending its support to the rescue effort with teams in Nepal already assessing the humanitarian need and a team of technical experts preparing to fly from the UK with supplies to provide clean water, sanitation and emergency food supplies.

And Christian Aid has made an initial £50,000 available to help victims.

Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond also said his thoughts were with the people of Nepal and everyone ""affected by the terrible loss of life and widespread damage caused by the earthquake"".

He added: ""We are in close contact with the Nepalese government. The British Embassy in Nepal is offering our assistance to the authorities and is providing consular assistance to British Nationals.""

About an hour after the initial quake a magnitude 6.6 aftershock hit, and smaller aftershocks could be felt through the region for hours.

A senior mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, said an avalanche swept the face of Mount Everest after the earthquake and government officials said at least 30 people were injured.

Gyanendra Shretha, an official with Nepal's mountaineering department, said the bodies of eight people had been recovered and an unknown number remain missing or injured.

A spokeswoman for Intrepid - who arrange treks in Nepal and around the Everest region - confirmed that they did have some groups which included Britons in the area, and said they were trying to get in touch with the tour groups.

A number of other Britons have also not been heard from since the quake struck.

Several are listed on Google's Person Finder tool under a section entitled 2015 Nepal Earthquake.

The database includes Sebastian Lovera, a 22-year-old qualified skiing and diving instructor, from Tonbridge, Kent.

His last known location was Khumjung on Tuesday, from where he was heading towards Everest Base Camp.

His step-father, Greg Smye-Rumsby, said: ""Sebastian is an extremely lively and self-motivating person and that is why he went to Napal.

""We haven't heard from him. He would not have switched his phone off. We have tried ringing it. Sometimes it rings and sometimes we get an answer but it's an automated answer. It says the phone is switched off.

""He's certainly not a person to take risks. He's the absolute opposite.""

Mr Lovera is described as being around 5ft 8in tall, with dark blond/light brown hair and very fit.

He has a red Black Diamond down jacket and brown Karrimor walking boots with a hole in the left boot.

Another Britons feared missing is Laura Wood, 23, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.

She is described by a friend as a ""g lowing lovely beautiful young girl often dressed in hippy type clothing"".

Miss Wood, who has a strong northern accent, has been trekking in the Himalayas without any means of making contact.

Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg said: ""My heart goes out to all the people of Nepal dealing with the after-effects of the earthquake that hit the region this morning.

""My thoughts are also with all the Nepalese people living here in the UK worried about their loved ones, including our Gurkha community, who are a shining testament to the resilience and great spirit of the Nepalese people. Our government will do everything we can to provide any help and assistance needed.""

The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal.

Alexander Matheou, director of programmes at the charity, said: ""This was a very powerful earthquake and its impact has been devastating. People are sleeping out in the open, too scared to return home while the aftershocks go on. Some have no home to return to.

""Search and rescue efforts are continuing, but some roads, especially in areas near the epicentre, have been damaged or blocked by landslides or rubble. We are extremely worried about these communities, especially those in Kathmandu Valley"".

Khathmandu, 25 April, (Asiantribune.com):

A powerful earthquake, according to Disaster Management Center (DMC) says that the 7.6 magnitude hit Nepal this morning, causing massive tremors lasting well over a minute across northern India, killing hundreds of people across a swath of four countries as the violently shaking earth collapsed houses, leveled centuries-old temples and triggered avalanches on Mt. Everest. It was the worst temblor to hit the South Asian nation in over 80 years.

The total death toll from the earthquake at the time of posting this news item has risen to 1,130 and at least 634 in the Kathmandu Valley and 300 more in the capital.

The quake caused dozens of buildings in Kathmandu to collapse, including the historic Dharahara Tower.

The city’s main hospital is overwhelmed by casualties and residents are facing a night on the streets with nowhere to go.

Appeal For International Assistance

The country’s deputy Prime Minister, Bamdev Gautam, has declared a state of emergency and appealed for humanitarian assistance across the region.

The earthquake also shook several cities across northern India, and was felt as far away as Lahore in Pakistan, Lhasa in Tibet, and in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Following the quake, Kathmandu's international airport was shut down.

Another 34 were killed in India, six in Tibet and two in Bangladesh. Two Chinese citizens died at the Nepal-China border.

A senior mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, said an avalanche swept the face of Mt. Everest after the earthquake, and government officials said at least 8 climbers were killed and 30 injured. Their nationalities were not immediately known.

Tshering of the Nepal Mountaineering Association said the avalanche occurred between the Khumbu Icefall, a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow, and the base camp where most climbing expeditions have their main camps.

In Delhi Tremors Were Felt

In Delhi and parts of India’s National Capital Region, people were seen running out of their houses after buildings shook for well over a minute. However, there are no reports of any damage in Delhi.

The earthquake also shook several cities across northern India, and was felt as far away as Lahore in Pakistan, Lhasa in Tibet, and in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

While the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster are yet to be ascertained, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of Nepal best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, is heavily dependent on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.

Tremors were also felt in Patna, Lucknow, Kolkata, Jaipur, Chandigarh and other cities.

Nearly half an hour after the first tremors, aftershocks were felt again around 12:20 pm across North India.

A senior mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, said an avalanche swept the face of Mt. Everest after the earthquake, and government officials said at least 8 climbres were killed and 30 injured. Their nationalities were not immediately known.

The quake's epicenter was 80 kilometers northwest of Kathmandu

The quake's epicenter was 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu, and it had a depth of only 11 kilometers (7 miles), which is considered shallow in geological terms. The shallower the quake the more destructive power it carries, and witnesses said the trembling and swaying of the earth went on for several minutes.

The U.S. Geological Survey revised the magnitude from 7.5 to 7.9 but then lowered it to 7.8. It said the quake hit at 11:56 a.m. local time at Lamjung. It was the largest shallow quake since the 8.2 temblor off the coast of Chile on April 1, 2014.

The quake -- with the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 -- was about 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.

A magnitude 7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while an 8 magnitude quake can cause tremendous damage.

India, Pakistan Sri Lanka rushes with Emergency assistance

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a meeting of top government officials to review the damage and disaster preparedness in parts of India that felt strong tremors. The Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Sikkim, which share a border with Nepal, have reported building damage. There have also been reports of damage in the northeastern state of Assam.

Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has also ordered an immediate dispatch of relief and medical teams to Nepal, and the evacuation of Indian tourists.

Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif offered ""all possible help"" that Nepal may need.

Sri Lanka to fly in medical personal drugs and food aid to earthquake struck Nepal and also evacuate students and other citizens trapped in the country, a government statement said.

A Sri Lanka Air Force aircraft with medical staff drugs and food will leave overnight at 7.00 am, the office of the Prime Minister said.

A civilian SriLankan Airlines aircraft with relief workers, emergency supplies and food will also leave for Nepal tomorrow.

The aircraft will bring back Sri Lankan students and others from Nepal.

UK foreign secretary Philip Hammond said the government was in close contact with the Nepal and the British Embassy in the country is offering assistance to the authorities and British Nationals.

THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN Affairs has set up an emergency response team in Dublin to handle calls from family members concerned for Irish citizens who may be stranded in Nepal, where a massive 7.9 magnitude earthquake killed more than 1,000 people.

The earthquake ripped through large parts of the country, toppling office blocks and towers in the panic-stricken capital Kathmandu.

Officials said that at least at least 1,170 people are known to have died in Nepal but that the toll could be many times higher, while casualties were also reported in neighbouring India and Bangladesh.

There were also reports of an avalanche at Mount Everest’s base camp in Nepal where scores of mountaineers have gathered at the start of the annual climbing season. At least ten people were killed in the avalanche.

Base camp was crowded with foreign mountaineers and their sherpa teams at the start at the climbing season when the avalanche hit, destroying camps and sending slabs of ice crashing in what was described as a “huge disaster”.

Snow is preventing helicopters from reaching climbers, an official said. “There might be over 1,000 people there right now, including foreign climbers and Nepalese supporting staffs. Rescue helicopters have not been able to fly because of the weather,” Gyanendra Kumar Shrestha, an official in Nepal’s tourism department, told AFP.

Irish people in Nepal

The Irish Independent has reported a group of 11 Irish people are now stranded in Nepal, though none were injured in the earthquake.

The Department of Foreign Affairs said an emergency response team in in place in Dublin to handle any calls about Irish people who are in the affected region. Anyone concerned about friends or family in the region can contact the Department on 014180200.

Minister Charlie Flanagan said his thoughts are with all those affected by the earthquake, and in particular with loved ones of those who have lost their lives.

“The situation on the ground in Nepal is still unfolding and my Department is working through our Embassy in New Delhi to provide assistance to any Irish affected.

“We are consulting with the UN and NGO partners to see how Ireland can best assist in the region.”

Death toll rising

At least a dozen bodies were taken away from the ruins of Kathmandu’s landmark Dharahara tower, according to an AFP photographer who saw similar scenes of multiple casualties in other parts of the city.

“In Kathmandu 71 have been reported dead so far,” home ministry spokesman Laxmi Prasad Dhakal told AFP as the scale of the disaster began to emerge. Another 43 had been reported dead in the nearby Bhaktapur district, he added.

While contact with Nepal was sporadic, a senior Nepalese diplomat warned that the final toll could run into many hundreds.

“We have received reports that there is a big loss of property and life in Nepal,” Krishna Prasad Dhakal, the deputy chief of mission at Nepal’s Embassy in New Delhi, told AFP.

“Possibly hundreds of people have died in various parts of the country, particularly in Kathmandu and Pokhara.”

Source: AP/Press Association Images

At least 42 people were known to have died in India, including 30 in the eastern state of Bihar, while buildings in the capital New Delhi had to be evacuated.

The United States Geological Survey and India’s meteorogical service said the shallow quake struck 81 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 0611 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside their homes.

“The walls of houses have collapsed around me onto the road. All the families are outside in their yards huddled together,” an AFP reporter said in Kathmandu.

Nepal earthquake collapses buildings in Kathmandu and northern India killing more than 2,200

Updated

Rescuers in Nepal are searching frantically for survivors of a huge quake that killed more than 2,200 people, digging through rubble in the devastated capital Kathmandu and airlifting victims of an avalanche at Everest base camp.

Terrified residents of Kathmandu were woken by fresh aftershocks in the worst disaster to hit the impoverished Himalayan nation in more than 80 years, with many forced to spend the night trying to sleep out on the streets and open ground in makeshift tents.

Hospitals were so stretched that medics had set up tents outside the buildings to treat patients.

The historic nine-storey Dharahara tower, a major tourist attraction, was among the buildings brought down, with at least a dozen bodies taken away from the ruins of the 19th century tower.

Dharmu Subedi, 36, was standing outside the tower when it collapsed.

""It was difficult to breathe, but I slowly moved the debris. Someone then pulled me out. I don't know where my friends are,"" said Mr Subedi from a hospital bed.

The tower had been open to visitors for the last 10 years and had a viewing balcony on its eighth floor.

Offers of help poured in from governments around the world, with the United States, European Union and Australia announcing they were sending in disaster response teams. India flew out its stranded citizens in military planes.

National police spokesman Kamal Singh Ban said the number known to have died in Nepal had risen to 1,953.

""We have deployed all our resources for search and rescues,"" he said.

""Helicopters have been sent to remote areas. We are sifting through the rubble where buildings have collapsed to see if we can find anyone.""

Officials said that 17 people were so far known to have died on Mount Everest where an avalanche triggered by the earthquake buried part of base camp.

It is the deadliest disaster in Everest's history and comes almost exactly a year after an avalanche killed 16 sherpa guides.

Police put the death toll in Nepal at 2,152, with more than 5,000 hurt. At least 700 were killed in the capital, a city of about 1 million people where many homes are old, poorly built and packed close together.

The overall toll from the quake was expected to be much higher, and at least 49 people have died in neighbouring India.

""We are using all our resources for rescue and to help the displaced,"" Rameshwor Dangal, who heads Nepal's Himalayan nation's National Disaster Management Division, said.

Chinese state media said 17 people had also been killed in Tibet as Beijing sent a team of 62 rescuers, accompanied by sniffer dogs, to help the hard-pressed emergency workers in Nepal.

The county's mobile phone network was working only sporadically, while large parts of the capital were without electricity.

Friends and family of the dozens of Australians missing in the region have taken to social media to appeal for public assistance.

Sleepless night as aftershocks continue

AFP correspondents in Kathmandu reported that tremors were felt throughout the night, including one strong aftershock at dawn.

""It has been a sleepless night, how can we sleep? It has been shaking all night. We are just praying that this will end and we can return home,"" said Nina Shrestha, a 34-year-old banker who spent the night with hundreds of people on open ground in the capital's Tudhikhel district.

As rescuers sifted through the huge mounds of rubble, the hospitals were overflowing with victims who suffered multiple fractures and trauma.

""We have treated many people since yesterday, majority children,"" said Samir, a doctor at Nepal's Annapurna Neurological Hospital.

""Most patients have head injuries or fractures. Two of our patients died, two are critical.""

Medics were working out of a tent set up in a parking lot because of overflowing patients, while some patients were too scared to stay in the building.

Families had grabbed whatever possessions they could muster and sought shelter on the streets, many of which had been split asunder.

Weather forecasters warned that rain was on the way, with dark clouds looming over Kathmandu that promised more misery for displaced survivors.

Hospitals running out of supplies

The quake, Nepal's worst in 81 years, was more destructive for being shallow, toppling buildings, opening gaping cracks in roads and sending people scurrying into the open as aftershocks rattled their damaged homes.

Kathmandu's Bir Hospital had so far received 300 to 350 patients with serious injuries, and most of them died, said paramedic Dinesh Chaudhary.

He said the hospital was running out of supplies and was procuring medicines from shops outside.

""There will be many more patients coming in tomorrow because only a very small part of the debris has been cleared,"" he said.

Indian tourist Devyani Pant was in a Kathmandu coffee shop with friends when ""suddenly the tables started trembling and paintings on the wall fell on the ground"".

""I screamed and rushed outside,"" she told Reuters by telephone from the capital, where at least 300 people died.

""We are now collecting bodies and rushing the injured to the ambulance.

""We are being forced to pile several bodies one above the other to fit them in.""

Siobhan Heanue in Kathmandu In the capital Kathmandu, old temples — many World Heritage-listed and some dating back to the Middle Ages — have been destroyed or damaged.



The three Royal Squares, Patan Bhaktapur and Kathmandu Durbar Squares, suffered significant damage.



In Patan, several temples collapsed, sending thousands of people running for their lives.



The square was packed with tourists and locals out enjoying a Saturday afternoon relaxing on temple stoops and wandering through the historic buildings.



The built-up surrounds of the square left people with few options for safe harbour when the quake hit.



People screamed in terror as the shaking intensified and historic buildings crumbled.



The earthquake, measuring 7.9 in magnitude, lasted for over a minute and was followed by several strong aftershocks.



Locals rushed to clear piles of rubble, searching for survivors with their bare hands, picks and shovels, amid a minimal police presence.



The rescuers sometimes tossed, sometimes gingerly lifted priceless cultural relics from the ruins as they scrambled to unearth any survivors.



At least 12 bodies were pulled from the rubble at Patan Durbar Square with no reports of survivors from under collapsed buildings in the temple complex.



The city of Kathmandu was encircled in clouds of dust, with injured people sitting bandaged in the street and many being stretchered out of buildings by neighbours or dragged from under the rubble of collapsed homes and businesses.



The taxi and bus system disintegrated, leading to an exodus of thousands of people walking through the streets of the capital to get home, many stopping to gawk at destroyed temples and houses.



People converged in open spaces like wide streets and parks as aftershocks continued into the night, huddling amid mounds of concrete and bricks removed from the site of collapsed buildings nearby.



The healthcare and emergency infrastructure of the developing nation already appears severely stretched by the magnitude of this natural disaster.



Compounding the crisis for Nepal, mountaineering season has just begun and many thousands of trekkers in the mountains may not be able to be contacted for days.

ABC reporter Siobhan Heanue was in the old part of the capital, and experienced the quake firsthand.

""At the ancient temple complex near Patan in the south of the city called Durbar Square several temples collapsed to the ground as people fled,"" she said.

""Shortly after rescue crews swung into action, locals and tourists even have been helping to clear the rubble.

""There were several violent aftershocks and Nepalese people have fled into open squares for safety.""

Victorian aid worker Wes Pryor was in Kathmandu when the earthquake struck, but said he had heard of more destruction elsewhere.

""There's reports of landslides blocking roads, whole parts of neighbourhoods being pushed down the valley and very significant casualties in those areas,"" he said.

""There are reports coming in from further west in Nepal, from Pokhara, where the epicentre of the earthquake was nearby, that there are villages there that are not there any more.""

He said people were calm, but expecting more chaos overnight.

""We expect it to rain so people are finding temporary shelter, rushing back into their homes — when it's safe to do so — to get cooking equipment and water, so by and large the city is now pretty stable, people are calm,"" he said.

""But as we have aftershocks and we see houses move a little bit we anticipate that there might be some more chaos going into the night.""

The US Geological Survey said the magnitude-7.9 quake struck 77 kilometres north-west of Kathmandu at lunchtime (local time), with walls crumbling and families racing outside their homes.

Strong tremors were felt as far away as New Delhi and other northern cities in India.

At least 34 people were known to have died in India, including 23 in the eastern state of Bihar, while buildings in the capital New Delhi had to be evacuated.

Laxman Singh Rathore, director-general of the Indian Meteorological Department, told reporters that the impact had been felt across large areas of the country.

""The intensity was felt in entire north India. More intense shocks were felt in eastern UP (Uttar Pradesh) and Bihar, equally strong in sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim,"" he said.

Mr Rathore said that a second tremor of magnitude 6.6 had been recorded around 20 minutes later and centred around the same region.

Indian prime minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet: ""We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal"".

The earthquake is Nepal's worst since a magnitude-8.3 quake struck the impoverished Himalayan nation in 1934, killing over 8,500 people.

NEPAL (KUSI) – The death toll continues to rise in Kathmandu, Nepal after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit the area Saturday afternoon.

The death toll increased from 1,457 to 3,200 Monday (NPT), but the full extent of damage is still unclear.

The number of those injured has reached 6,500.

As the numbers continue to rise, locals are starting to worry about the aftereffects of the quake.

""I'm feeling exhausted but also scared because the tremors have been by the dozens,” Dr. Samaj Gautam told The New York Times. “But the most worrying thing to me is the aftereffect. Sanitation, disease, these are also serious worries.”

UNICEF said its relief workers were watching for waterborne and infectious diseases.

Landslides are making rescue efforts increasingly difficult as many mountain roads are completely impassable.

The region was rocked by aftershocks most of Sunday, one of which measure at a magnitude of 6.7, causing more damage and fear.

The United States Geological Survey said the quake occurred at a depth of 9.3 miles, which is considered shallow and more damaging than a deeper quake.

The epicenter of the quake was less than 50 miles away from Kathmandu, which is home to over 1 million people.

Aftershocks in Tibet buckled roads and collapsed buildings. Twenty deaths have been reported.

Four Chinese citizens in Nepal during the quake have been reported dead as well.

India reported 61 deaths.

The earthquake set of avalanches on Mount Everest, killing at least 18 people.

Dan Fredinburg, a Google executive with ties to Southern California, was among those killed on Mount Everest.

Fredinburg's younger sister posted this message on his Instagram account following the quake:

""This is Dan's little sister Megan. I regret to inform all who loved him that during the avalanche on Everest early this morning our Dan suffered from a major head injury and didn't make it. We appreciate all of the love that has been sent our way thus far and know his soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us. All our love and thanks to those who shared this life with our favorite hilarious strong willed man. He was and is everything to us. Thank you.""

Thomas Nybo, a freelance photographer, told CNN chaos broke out in the streets of Temal, a densely populated tourist hub, as the earthquake hit at noon.

""This region is no stranger to earthquakes,"" he said. ""A lot of people had the same feeling: this is a tremor, it passed. When that wasn't the case, they were in uncharted territory ... It's basically an unwritten book.""

Nybo said people and children were trapped under piles of rubble and emergency responders didn't appear in the area until about two hours after the quake.

""A group of mainly tourists started gathering rocks, hammers and pickaxes and breaking through a re-enforced concrete wall to reach this guy ... It took about two hours of smashing through wall and cutting re-bar with a hacksaw to pull him out alive,"" Nybo said.

Many tourists and residents are sleeping on the streets, despite the dropping temperatures and rainfall. Nybo said many were too scared to go back indoors as aftershocks continued through the night.

On Saturday (local time) Secretary of State John Kerry said the American ambassador to Nepal, Peter W. Bodde, had issued a disaster declaration that would allow $1 million in humanitarian assistance to be available immediately.

The U.N. Embassy in Nepal said American disaster response teams are on their way to Nepal to assist.

The San Diego-based International Relief Team (IRT) is working quickly to send relief aid to the victims of the Nepalese earthquake.

IRT was one of the first responders after the quake and has already ordered a shipment of emergency medicines to Nepal from the Netherlands.

The shipment should be there by mid-next week .

The IRT has provided more than $298 million in 26 years of service to countries affected by natural and other disasters.

Anyone who wishes to help those affected in Nepal is encouraged to contact the Red Cross or the International Relief Teams for ways to donate.

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua became the first international news agency to have reported a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struke somewhere less than 60 km from Nepal's capital, Kathmandu at 11:45 am local time (0600 GMT) on Saturday.

According to a senior official with the country's Home Ministry, the death toll had reached at least 711.

Zhou Shengping, chief correspondent of the Xinhua Bureau in Nepal, along with seven local employees, rushed to ground zero to cover the disaster.

In the meantime, Xinhua has also launched an emergent reporting scheme, sending multiple teams from different areas to Nepal.

Wu Qiang, chief correspondent in New Delhi, and Zhao Yi, chief correspondent in Kabul, have headed to Kathmandu with equipment of marisat systems.

Xinhua has also dispatched an reinforcement team of reporters Zhang Ning, Xu Yanyan and Qin Qing, together with engineer Wang Xiaowei, who had been covering the Asian-African Summit in Indonesia to Nepal, with live broadcasting equipment.

In addition, Bai Yang, Xinhua reporter from Xinhua headquarters in Beijing, would fly to Nepal along with Chinese rescue teams.

The great earthquake has also violently jolted China's Tibet Autonomous Region and surrounding areass.

Strong tremors were felt in the city of Shigatse and Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region.

Xinhua's Tibet Bureau has sent three teams of reporters and technical staffs to quake-hit areas.

An Australian born man, 43-year-old Jason Upton, who has been living in the UK is also listed among the missing.

Zachary Sheridan, the younger brother of Packed to the Rafters star Hugh Sheridan is also unaccounted for at Mt Everest.

The 20-year-old last contacted his family on April 22 from Namche Bazar, described as the gateway to Everest.

A DFAT spokesman said anyone needing consular assistance could contact DFAT on 1300 555 135 or from overseas on +61 6261 3305.

The Australian embassy was reportedly damaged in the quake.

Fairfax Media journalist Angela Macdonald-Smith was in Thamel, a key tourist area of Kathmandu, when the earthquake struck at around 4pm Australian time.

""Everything is chaos amid rubble in Thamel after earthquake hits Kathmandu,"" she wrote on Twitter.

""We are waiting outside hotel for advice, people calmer now but each aftershock brings mass hysteria. Still small aftershocks, brick walls swaying in Thamel each time, huge cracks in buildings.

""They are saying go somewhere safe but nowhere feels safe,"" she said.

Major buildings were reduced to rubble in key tourist spots, including Durbar Square and the ancient religious complex Swayambhunath, also known as the 'Monkey Temple'.

More than a dozen people died at the 19th-century Dharara Tower in the centre of Kathmandu when the tall building collapsed, according to an AFP photographer at the scene.

Aftershocks continued for several hours after the original earthquake, which shook buildings in India and Bangladesh and triggered earthquakes on Mount Everest which buried part of the base camp, killing eight people.

Armed police patrolled the streets, where there were scenes of mass devastation, with temples reduced to rubble, roads cracked and warped, and injured people covered in dust.

The earthquake was centred 77 kilometres north-west of Kathmandu, the US Geological Survey said.

Mountaineer Alex Gavan tweeted from Mount Pumori, about 8 kilometres west of Mount Everest, that the quake had caused an avalanche on Everest.

""Everest base camp huge earthquake then huge avalanche from Pumori. Running for life from my tent. Unhurt. Many many people up the mountain,"" tweeted Gavan.

200 safe but many Aussies missing in Nepal

More than 200 Australians have been confirmed safe but authorities are trying to contact hundreds of others missing after more than 2000 people were killed in a massive earthquake in Nepal.

The government has committed $5 million in aid and a crisis response team will travel to Nepal to look for the unaccounted travellers among the 549 Australians who registered with the foreign affairs department.

There are no reports of Australian deaths following Saturday's 7.8-magnitude earthquake.

But worried family and friends have turned to social media.

Australian actor Hugh Sheridan's brother is missing.

""Please. Anyone who is awake, please pray for my little brother Zachary who is on Mt Everest,"" Mr Sheridan tweeted.

Mother Deb Williams's Brisbane-based son Jai was due to be at Mount Everest base camp on Saturday with his friend Ben Flanders.

After a nervous wait she was greeted with the news she had been waiting for.

""The boys are safe,"" she posted on Facebook.

West Australian Ballantyne Paige Forder contacted her family on Sunday after helping move the orphanage where she worked to a field.

Amanda-Sue Markham tweeted on Sunday: ""My baby sister is safe. Prayers answered as she and the orphanage moved to safety"".

Other families are still waiting for information on their loved ones.

Mitch Graves is at home in Sydney waiting for news on the fate of his 24-year-old brother Matthew Graves, who was travelling through Pokhara.

""It's a bit of a struggle trying to communicate to everyone. It is a waiting game at the moment,"" he said.

The earthquake's epicentre was about 80km northwest of Kathmandu and it is the worst to hit the area in 80 years, World Vision Australia chief Tim Costello said.

""This is a huge disaster,"" he said on Sunday.

""As the full extent of this enormous tragedy emerges, every minute counts. We must act immediately to save lives and help those who are suffering.""

About 200 World Vision staff in Nepal are dispatching emergency supplies, he said.

Red Cross workers on the scene are administering first aid, organising blood supplies for medical centres and providing food, shelter and water.

""It's now a race against time to rescue those trapped under rubble, help the injured and support the survivors,"" Australian Red Cross's Peter Walton said.

""We are very concerned for the safety and wellbeing of thousands of people in Nepal and across the region.""

A team from the Fred Hollows Foundation with Australian, Vietnamese, Bangladeshi and Pakistani members was in Nepal when the earthquake struck but all have been confirmed safe.

The government's pledged $5 million aid will be split with $2.5 million going to Australian NGOs, $2 million being sent to support United Nations Partners and $500,000 offered to the Australian Red Cross.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has opened its emergency call unit and updated travel advice for Nepal, warning of disruptions to communication, transport and tourist infrastructure in the country.

Thousands of people are on the streets in Kathmandu where everything remains in the dark with power out, said an ActionAid Australia spokeswoman who had been in contact with colleagues in Nepal.

""Nobody slept,"" she told AAP.

Hospitals are still operating but thousands of injured people are queuing, waiting for assistance at already-stretched medical centres, she said.

Land slips and damaged infrastructure has also made it difficult to travel to affected communities, she added.

Further information is being sought from ActionAid workers in Nepal.

People across Bangladesh got panicked by multiple foreshocks and aftershocks of the powerful earthquake which jolted Nepal and some parts of India and China yesterday.

Morsheda Begum died in Dupchanchia of Bogra when a wall collapsed on her.

At least two women, in Pabna and Tangail, died of heart attacks during the jolts while over 200 people, including students and workers at garment factories, were injured as they tried to get out of buildings hurriedly.

Cracks developed in some factory buildings while some high-rise buildings in the capital had tilted.

The earthquake devastated Nepalese capital Kathmandu and many parts of India. It left at least 1,341 people killed in Nepal, 45 in India, and 13 in China.

Panicked people of the capital and other parts of the country rushed out of buildings and high-rises to the streets below.

“I was walking down Dhanmondi-32 and suddenly saw large waves in Dhanmondi Lake. The water leaped a few feet upwards during the tremor,” claimed columnist and rights activist Syed Abul Maksud over the telephone.

Former school teacher Rokeya Khanam Eti, 60, died of a heart attack in Pabna, reported our Pabna correspondent quoting her husband Sohrab Hossain.

Housewife Parina Begum in Tangail died of a cardiac arrest in Syedpur village in Mirzapur upazila during the earthquake, reports our correspondent there.

Several buildings were reportedly damaged in the capital and elsewhere in the country, including in Bogra, Narayanganj, Natore and Rajshahi.

There were reports of damaged buildings from the capital's Shakhari Bazar, Bangabazar, Jatrabari, Shyam Bazar areas and on Kamal Ataturk Avenue in Banani.

GM Jainal Abedin Bhuiya, chairman of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha, said building-259/1 constructed without approval in Bangshal was leaning on the under-construction building next door.

“We have evacuated both the buildings and sealed them off,” he said, adding, “We will check whether Ahmed Tower on Kamal Ataturk Avenue had tilted.”

The 25-storey Ahmed Tower was leaning on the adjoining FR Tower on Kamal Ataturk Avenue. During a visit, The Daily Star correspondent saw that there was a gap of around two feet between the two buildings on the ground floor but the tops of the two buildings were touching each other.

Asha Tower in Shyamoli, Ershad Colony in Islambagh and Barisal Plaza near Bangabazar also tilted and cracks had developed in four buildings in Old Dhaka, Tejgaon and Sheorapara of the capital.

The administrative building of Islamic University and the General Hospital in Kushtia and a 10-storey building in Feni also reportedly developed cracks.

Over 200 people, including garment workers and schoolgoers, were injured in different places in the country when they rushed out of buildings.

At least 50 garment workers were injured inside the 10-storey building of Al-Muslim Group at Ulail in Gazipur when the workers were rushing towards the exit, reports our Savar correspondent.

Our correspondents reported that around 15 workers of a garment factory in Ishwardi EPZ, 20 workers in two apparel factories in Fatullah, 40 in Nilphamari, and 40 in Manikganj were injured. About 40 students of Chatmohar Pilot School, Atghoria Pilot School, and Pabna Central Girls School fell sick during the tremor.

Ten schoolchildren at a Kalikabari Primary School in Dhubaura of Mymensingh and 20 people in Rajshahi were reported to have been injured.

Panic left about 50 workers injured in a garment factory in Savar as they were trying to rush out of the building believing it would collapse. The factory is in the same upazila as was Rana Plaza, which collapsed two years ago killing over 1,100 people.

Shumi Akter, a worker of the factory of Al-Muslim Group said, ""We thought that the building was collapsing like Rana Plaza, which was only half a kilometre away from our factory … .""

Farhad Hosen Khan, assistant general manager of Al-Muslim Group, said all the workers of the factory dashed for the exit around 12:15pm.

Following rumours that the Al-Muslim factory was collapsing, relatives of the workers rushed to the factory area and started demonstrations.

They also threw brick chunks at the factory and vandalised its windows, said Farhad.

The injured were rushed to the Enam Medical College Hospital and Savar Upazila Health Complex, hospital sources said.

Experts said Bangladeshis felt the ground shaking really hard this time. The country had not experienced such a high magnitude tremor so close to its border (500 kilometres) since 1934, when an earthquake of 8.4 magnitude hit the same area.

The Met office in Dhaka said the epicentre of the earthquake was at a shallow depth in the Barpak region of Nepal, 745km from Agargaon.

The office recorded eight foreshocks and aftershocks from 12:14pm.

“People who live in houses built on soft soil are supposed to feel the shaking more,” said Prof Syed Akhter Humayun of the geology department of Dhaka University. He has been researching on earthquake for years.

The quake was caused due to the slip of the Indian tectonic plate and Eurasian plate in the shallow depth, just 10 kilometre bellow the ground, he said.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepalese tourist guide Naba Raj Amgai had just returned home from a mountain-biking trip when his home in the capital Kathmandu began to shake, sending a fridge and television smashing to the ground.

He and his wife bolted for the stairs. Outside, his neighbours were pouring onto the street, shouting and crying.

""It was horrible,"" said Amgai, who was standing out on the street several hours later. ""I still haven't gone back inside.""

The magnitude 7.9 earthquake, Nepal's biggest for 81 years, struck west of Kathmandu just before noon on Saturday. Officials said it had killed at least 1,130 people in the Himalayan nation and dozens in neighbouring countries.

The quake was also felt across Bangladesh, northern India and Chinese Tibet, collapsing ancient buildings, modern complexes and modest village homes.

Eyewitnesses described scenes of panic and confusion in the Nepali capital when the ground started shaking beneath their feet, sending people running out of their homes and onto streets choked with thick dust.

""The ground underneath me was shaking. I thought I was going to sink into it,"" said Hari Adhikari, a 60-year-old vegetable seller.

In Patan, a densely packed neighbourhood, a Reuters reporter heard neighbours screaming as the first tremor hit.

""I was eating near the city centre in Kathmandu when suddenly the tables started trembling and paintings on the wall fell on the ground,"" Devyani Pant, an Indian tourist in Kathmandu, told Reuters. ""I screamed and rushed outside.""

Across the region, people were injured in the scramble to get out of shaking buildings and onto safer ground.

In the Indian state of West Bengal, dozens of children were caught up in stampedes to leave two different school buildings, according to an official in Malda district, with several sustaining minor injuries.

In Bangladesh, buildings across the old part of the capital Dhaka cracked from the impact, and several workers in a garment factory were hurt as they rushed to escape.

""TREMENDOUS CRISIS""

As the aftershocks continued to rock Kathmandu, people remained in the streets.

Phone lines were jammed.

""We have been flooded with phone calls from all around the world,"" Mohan Krishna Sapkota, joint secretary in the Nepal tourism ministry, told Reuters. ""We are facing a tremendous crisis here and it is hard to even assess what the death toll and the extent of damage could be.""

The ministry estimated that 300,000 foreign tourists and trekkers were in Nepal when the earthquake struck. There were reports that at least 18 people had been killed in an avalanche unleashed by the earthquake that swept through the climbers' base camp on the world's highest mountain, Everest.

In hospitals in the capital, nurses and doctors moved patients outside, setting up makeshift treatment areas. One patient told a Reuters reporter he had broken his leg when he jumped from the third floor of a building.

By nightfall, as the death toll climbed, volunteers had started to help authorities gather bodies and pile them into ambulances. Residents, instructed not to return to their homes, had begun to set up camps for the night.

At the Smarak school in Patan, some 350 people gathered on a playing field, setting up tents, with volunteers handing out tea and water.

Yira Lama, who had been living in a rented room in Kathmandu but comes from a village not far from the epicentre, said he planned to stay the night there.

""I spoke to my family in the village and they said our house has been completely destroyed,"" he said.

UPDATED 9:40 p.m. PT

Hundreds of people are dead, ancient temples are in ruin and Nepal is a zone of devastation after the country was hit on Saturday with its worst earthquake in 80 years.

Just before midday, an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.8 struck the poor South Asian nation, killing at least 1,800 people in Nepal and dozens more in neighboring countries, authorities told The Associated Press. The death toll is expected to rise. At least 17 people were also killed at Mount Everest, with 61 injured. More than two dozen were killed in India, Tibet and Bangladesh.



People being pulled from a collapsed building.

The quake's epicenter was 80 km (50 miles) east of Nepal's second largest city, Pokhara, and 77 km (48 miles) northwest of the capital city, Kathmandu, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The capital was the hardest hit along with the densely populated Kathmandu Valley. Following the quake, a magnitude 6.6 aftershock hit and multiple smaller quakes trembled across the region.

The collision of Earth's plates that gave rise to the Himalayas can cause major earthquakes in northern India, Pakistan and Nepal. The Indian and Asian plates are still grinding against one another, releasing energy through such tremors. An EU report said Nepal was the 11th most vulnerable country to earthquakes.

Yet a natural disaster of this scale is rare in the region, according to the USGS. The largest quake in Nepal's recorded history, a magnitude 8.0 temblor in 1934, hit near Kathmandu causing severe damage and killing more than 10,000 people. Only four earthquakes over magnitude 6 have hit within 250 km of the epicenter of Saturday's quake. In August 1988, a 6.9 magnitude quake hit causing 1,500 deaths.

The quake Saturday had a depth of only 11 kilometers (7 miles), which is considered shallow in geological terms. The shallower the quake the more destructive power it carries.

Pushpa Das, a laborer, tried to flee a home when the first quake struck but injured his arm when a wall collapsed. He told the AP it was ""very scary."" He said: ""The earth was moving ... I am waiting for treatment but the [hospital] staff is overwhelmed.""

This man was buried under rubble during the earthquake, but he was dug out by rescuers:

The earthquake also shook several cities across northern India, and was felt as far away as Lahore in Pakistan, Lhasa in Tibet, and in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

At Mount Everest, the earthquake apparently triggered an avalanche, killing at least eight people and leaving others injured or missing.

The Khumbu Icefall route to Everest's summit reportedly collapsed. The avalanche apparently spared the base camp, but injuries were reported there.

As the ground began to shake, several buildings collapsed in the center of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers, resident Prachanda Sual told the AP.

The Dharahara Tower, one of Kathmandu's landmarks built by Nepal's royal rulers in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognized historical monument, was reduced to rubble. There were also reports of people trapped underneath.

The Kathmandu Valley is densely populated with nearly 2.5 million people, and the quality of buildings is often poor.

While the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster are yet to be ascertained, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of Nepal, a poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, is heavily dependent on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.

In Kathmandu, dozens of people were gathered in the parking lot of Norvic International Hospital, where thin mattresses were spread on the ground for patients rushed outside, some wearing hospital pajamas. A woman with a bandage on her head sat in a set of chairs pulled from the hospital waiting room.

Doctors and nurses had hooked up some patients to IV drops in the parking lot, or were giving people oxygen.

The U.S. Geological Survey revised the magnitude from 7.5 to 7.9 but then lowered it to 7.8. It said the quake hit at 11:56 a.m. local time (0611 GMT) at Lamjung. It was the largest shallow quake since the 8.2 temblor off the coast of Chile on April 1, 2014.

An earthquake's power increases by 10 times with each increase in the number of its scale. A magnitude 7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while a magnitude 8 quake can cause tremendous damage.

This means Saturday's earthquake — the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 — was far more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.

A Swedish woman, Jenny Adhikari, who lives in Nepal, told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that she was riding a bus in the town of Melamchi when the earth began to move.

""A huge stone crashed only about 20 meters from the bus,"" she was quoted as saying. ""All the houses around me have tumbled down. I think there are lot of people who have died,"" she told the newspaper by telephone. Melamchi is about 45 km (30 miles) northeast of Kathmandu.

The sustained quake also was felt in India's capital of New Delhi. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a meeting of top government officials to review the damage and disaster preparedness in parts of India that felt strong tremors. The Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Sikkim, which share a border with Nepal, have reported building damage. There have also been reports of damage in the northeastern state of Assam.

Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif offered ""all possible help"" that Nepal may need.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States is working with Nepal's government to provide aid. He added that U.S. Ambassador to Nepal Peter Bodde ""has issued a disaster declaration in order to immediately release an initial $1 million for humanitarian assistance."" Read Kerry's full statement, here.

India rushes to help quake-hit Nepal

New Delhi, Apr 25, 2015, DHNS: 2:19 IST

Aircraft carrying aid materials, NDRF personnel and mobile hospital already sent

India on Saturday rushed to help Nepal, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking to leaders of the neighbouring country soon after it was hit by a massive earthquake.



He subsequently sent four aircraft with relief and rescue materials as well as National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel.



The Indian Air Force (IAF) will also deploy at least five helicopters on Sunday to support the Nepalese government’s rescue and relief efforts.



At least 250 Indian citizens stranded in Nepal were being evacuated on Saturday, while more are likely to be brought home in the coming days.



“Nepal’s pain is our pain,” said Modi, after instructing the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and other wings of the Central government to do all they could to help the neighbouring country, where India competes with China for clout.



“I have spoken to Nepal’s president (Ram Baran Yadav) and prime minister (Sushil Koirala), and assured them that this country of 125 crore is with you,” said Modi on Saturday evening, after conferring the 2014 Jnanpith Award on Marathi author Bhalchandra Nemade.



Both the MEA and Embassy of India in Kathmandu have set up control rooms with dedicated phone numbers to help rescue and relief operations as well as evacuation of Indians from Nepal.



External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj was interacting with anxious members of the families of Indians stranded in Nepal, and sought their help so that Indian Embassy officials could locate them.



A C-130 transport aircraft of the IAF—with three tonnes of relief materials, 36 NDRF personnel and a mobile hospital with doctors and paramedics—landed at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu within a few hours of the quake.



Though the airport was closed for commercial flights immediately after the quake, the IAF sent two C-17 aircraft from the Hindon airbase in Uttar Pradesh. Another aircraft would take off from Bhatinda in Punjab, said Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar.



All the aircraft are carrying rescue and relief materials and NDRF personnel, he said, adding that they would also carry out aerial reconnaissance to assess the extent of devastation around Kathmandu.



New Delhi will send a special engineering team to Kathmandu to help rescue operations, said the Foreign Secretary. He also advised Indians stranded in Nepal or their families in India to contact the control rooms at the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu and the MEA headquarters in New Delhi.



India’s ties with Nepal have been among the priorities of the Modi government’s foreign policy. The prime minister visited Nepal twice within just six months after taking charge—first in August for a bilateral visit and then in November to attend the 18th SAARC summit.



The August visit was in fact the first by an Indian prime minister in 17 years.“The magnitude of the earthquake has disturbed the heart. The extent of the damage is not yet known. May God give them the strength to deal with the situation,” said Modi, who has been in touch with New Delhi’s envoy to Kathmandu, Ranjit Rae, to personally monitor India’s efforts to help Nepal.



Kathmandu’s ambassador-designate to New Delhi, Deep Kumar Upadhyay, said the people and government of Nepal were thankful to India for rushing to help in this hour of crisis. He said his country would need more mobile medical units from India, besides other assistance.



The Prime Minister’s Office also got in touch with Embassy of India in Thimphu immediately after the quake to check if Bhutan required any assistance from India. The Bhutanese government, however, informed the Indian Embassy in Thimphu that no casualty or major damage had been reported there after the quake.

Toronto’s 10,000-strong Nepalese-Canadian community is preparing itself for a massive relief effort as if reels in the face of a deadly earthquake back home that has killed more than 1,000 people.

Community leaders have been fielding scores of calls throughout Saturday from compatriots anxious about family in Nepal, where the death toll is rising rapidly after the country’s worst earthquake in 80 years.

Anil Thapa, president of the Non-Resident Nepalese Association Canada, found that his relatives back in Nepal were all right, but he said his “ancestor’s house,” build by his grandfather more than 40 years ago, has collapsed.

“It was build by mud and stone,” said Thapa, whose family lives in Palung, 80 kilometres from the capital of Kathmandu. “It was not made of solid cement and it was standing there till last night.”

“It happened in the morning at 4 a.m., but till 8 a.m. I was not connected with my family,” Thapa said. “At 8 a.m., somehow a cell phone worked.”

One leader told the Star the community will be holding an emergency meeting Saturday afternoon at Napalese Community Network in Toronto, where they will decide on a collective way to approach the 7.8-magnitute tremor. About 30 prominent members of the community from across the country — some who are appearing via video — are expected to be present.

“We’re trying to figure out how we can have a dialogue with the Canadian government and approach the community and do a fundraising for the people,” said Thapa.

Thapa said the community will be appealing to the Canadian government for help and will also be looking into sending a team to help on the ground. Specifics are expected be hashed out at the meeting.

“It’s not something, right away, that we can change,” he said. “It will take time to reconstruct everything. It might even take two, three years.”

The earthquake had collapsed modern houses and centuries-old temples, and triggered a landslide on the slopes of Mount Everest.

Thapa, who took more than 80 calls Saturday, said a small number of people whose families were living in rural areas were not able to contact their loved ones as the far-reaching earthquake cut off communications.

Thapa is appealing for help from the Canadian public.

“This is coming from the bottom of my heart,” he said. “We request all Canadians to come forward to help Nepal in this situation.”

A number of non-profit organizations are current accepting donations, including Plan Canada, the Canadian Red Cross, Unicef Canada, CARE Canada. Information can be found on the organizations’ websites.

The Nepalese Canadian Community Services has launched a fundraising campaign for the victims of earthquake. Gopal Bhandari, president of the organization, says his team will also be emailing members to appeal for the money and has set a preliminary target of $50,000.

Bhandari, 58, said on Saturday he had been up since 4 a.m., fielding more than 60 calls — “Family, friends, everyone was calling with news of the disaster.” The email will go to about 1,000 people who are subscribed to updates, out of the 10,000 Nepalese in Toronto.

He added there are many compatriots in Canada whose families are made homeless by the earthquake and the community wants Ottawa to allow them to sponsor relatives who have lost their homes to come to Canada.

“I’d like to appeal to the government of Canada, provincial and federal, to support the Nepalese who are homeless in Nepal and whose families are working in Canada,” he said, “I’d like to request to bring their children (here).”

The driving instructor, who left Nepal 27 years ago and worked for years as a chef for the Sutton Place Hotel until it closed in 2012, said “we are hoping to raise $50,000 through our PayPl account as an immediate response.”

Pitambar Bhattarai, secretary of the Nepalese Canadian Network of Canada, said the will be another meeting for the community on Sunday in the Peel region, the details of which are yet to be finalized.

Nursing student Shirshir Pandey, 37, owns a 1,200-student private college in Katmandu. As far as he knows, the building is still standing. But he frets about the students and their families: “everyone is sleeping on the ground outside tonight. They are worried about aftershocks.”

Since the earthquake occurred in a remote area outside Katmandu, Pandey is said it will take time to find out how many more have been lost.

Real estate agent Laxman Subedi, 30, left Nepal five years ago and is eager to help the victims, “And they are seeking support from us. So we are trying to organize a way to help.”

Sharmila Shrestha, 49, who has been in Canada for seven years said her family home sustained cracks, but no one was injured. “I am very scared for other people,” she said. “I’ve seen so many terrible pictures.”

Sushila Bhandari, 57, president of the Nepalese Women’s Association of Canada, said she grew up hearing stories about Nepal’s last devastating earthquake 80 years ago.

KATHMANDU, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The whole city of Kathmandu was shaking violently. Many buildings collapsed, and rubble and debris could be seen scattered among cracked streets.

A Xinhua reporter in Kathmandu has witnessed a violent 7.8 magnitude earthquake that stroke somewhere less than 60 km away from Nepal's capital, Kathmandu at 11:45 am local time (0600 GMT) on Saturday.

According a senior official with the country's Home Ministry, the death toll had reached at least 711.

The sudden quake plunged the whole city into chaos and panic. Residents huddled in the streets and other outdoor places.

Telecommunications were also seriously damaged citywide, with a large number of people unable to be accounted for at the moment.

A witness told Xinhua that a building of a four-star hotel has collapsed with many guests still trapped inside.

Police and the army were trying to help people trapped under the rubble. Ambulances and rescue teams have been dispatched to the worst-hit areas, with helicopters hovering above Kathmandu, a city of 1 million population.

A hospital near the city's downtown area was already overwhelmed by people who sought first-aid treatment. The injured were being treated in makeshift shelters outside the hospital.

The weather was fine in Kathmandu, which would not affect most rescue operations.

The quake also devastated many historical sites in the city. Two thirds of the buildings at the Kathmandu Durbar Square, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, were reduced to a heap of ruins, while the walls of the old royal palaces of Nepal crumbled into pieces.

In addition, the landmark tower Dharahara, which was built in 1832, collapsed almost completely, with many people feared being buried under the rubble.

The Kathmandu airport has been temporarily shut down.

Xie Bin, a Chinese tourist in Nepal, told Xinhua that his tourist group, comprised of about 200 Chinese citizens, was stranded in Kathmandu Airport. But no one was injured.

According to Cheng Ji, the counselor to the Chinese embassy in Nepal, two Chinese nationals who worked at the China-Nepal border, were killed in the quake.

He also said that as many Chinese tourists were traveling on foot in the country where infrastructure was underdeveloped, the embassy still needed more time to give an accurate report on casualty of Chinese citizens.

Aftershocks continued to ripple through the region hours after the powerful earthquake. Many people were waiting in the open air for fear of more powerful tremors.

Over 1,500 people were killed and thousands were injured when a massive earthquake - lasting about 20 frightening seconds - and several strong aftershocks caused widespread destruction in Nepal. India too was affected.

In Nepal, buildings were flattened, roads cracked, telephone connectivity snapped and hospitals grappled with a large number of injured who were extricated from the rubble after the country was hit by the temblor at 11.41 a.m. India time. The epicentre of the quake was Nepal's Lamjung district, some 75 km northwest of capital Kathmandu. Over 50 aftershocks were also felt.

According to Nepal's Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat, at least 1,570 people have died in the disaster.

Citing the Nepal Army, he told reporters that 1,457 bodies have been recovered from various quake-hit sites while 1,055 people were injured.

In Sindhupalchowk district, over 250 were killed.

In Kathmandu alone, 181 people were killed, in Bhaktapur 144, and in Lalitpur district 88. Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur together form Nepal's capital.

Indian Home Secretary L.C. Goel told the media that 34 people were killed in India. There were 23 dead in Bihar, three were killed in West Bengal while eight people died in Uttar Pradesh.

The tremors were felt across India, right from Srinagar to Kochi, and Jaipur to Guwahati.

At least two Indians have died in Nepal.

""I can confirm only two Indian deaths now -- one in the embassy and one in a hospital,"" Ambassador Rae said.

Asked about other Indian casualties, he said it was difficult to give exact figures as the phone lines were down and it was tough to contact the proper authorities.

He said the embassy was in touch with some Indians stranded in Muktinath and Jomsom, adding that embassy officials have been dispatched to hotels and hospitals.

The ambassador said that around 250 Indians were being evacuated on Saturday night.

Kathmandu, which is a much sought after tourist destination, bore the brunt of the devastation. People watched in disbelief as a number of its old buildings, including the Dharahara - a nine-storey 19th-century tower - collapsed. There was also damage to the walls surrounding Nepal's royal palace.

The revered Pashupatinath temple did not appear to have suffered any major damage.

Ten mountaineers were killed at the Mount Everest Base Camp when the temblor triggered an avalanche, an official at the Nepal tourism ministry said.

The earth heaved and panic-stricken people rushed out of their homes and offices.

IANS correspondent Anil Giri, who is based in Kathmandu, spoke of the horror.

He said over 1,000 buildings in Kathmandu have been destroyed, including historical structures. Thousands of people were out in the open. Electricity has been cut-off and wi-fi services are down. Hospitals are packed with the injured and the army is out in full force to help rescue people.

Kathmandu is a warren of tightly packed houses and narrow streets and these were filled with wailing people who panicked further as aftershocks rocked the area.

A young woman, who clutched a blood soaked handkerchief to her forehead, cried and said that she was worried about her family. She said that she did not get the time to safely escape from her home which came crashing down. ""I was terrified,"" she said at a hospital here.

A former Nepal minister said there had been ""massive damage"" at the epicentre Lamjung.

Sadbhavana Party chief Rajendra Mahto told IANS that it was difficult to estimate the loss so soon after the disaster but Kathmandu and its neighbourhood had suffered a lot of damage.

""We will need support from neighbours, especially India, and international agencies...,"" said Mahto, who was a member of the first Constituent Assembly and a minister in several administrations.

The Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu was indefinitely shut on Saturday, resulting in the cancellation of all the eight subsequent return flights from India bound for the capital city.

The airport, according to aviation officials in Delhi, was opened in the evening, but only for non-commercial and relief operations. Some airlines like SpiceJet said they had been asked by Indian authorities to keep an aircraft ready to lift supplies from here and bring back stranded passengers.

Soon after the quake struck, an IndiGo flight for Nepal, which had left at 11:30 a.m. from New Delhi, had to be recalled and the departures of two others were suspended, official here said. The flight of Nepalese carrier Buddha Air, bound for Varanasi, was among the eight flights that were called off.

The daughter of an employee of the Indian embassy was killed when a building in the embassy complex in Kathmandu collapsed.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi promptly directed dispatch of relief and rescue teams, including medical help to Nepal, as well as to the affected areas in India.

He chaired a high-level meeting to review the situation.

Modi spoke to Nepal President Ram Baran Yadav and Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who was abroad, and assured all assistance. He also spoke to the chief ministers of affected states in India like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Sikkim and Madhya Pradesh.

A meeting of the Nepal cabinet was held in the evening. It termed the earthquake a national crisis and sought international help.

India has sent two plane loads of relief material and rescue personnel to Nepal. The planes carried 45 rescue personnel and some sniffer dogs to help in rescue operations.

An air force spokesperson said that the Kathmandu airport runway was intact and aircraft could land there. All civilian flights have been cancelled.

Images showed that the quake had left the people of Nepal stunned. Besides capital Kathmandu and Besisahar in Lamjung, the cities which were affected include Bharatpur, Pokhara and Kirtipur.

Indian Ambassador Ranjit Rae told IANS that ""the old towns in the Kathmandu Valley have been affected in the earthquake"".

Witnesses said this appeared to be ""the most massive earthquake to hit central Nepal since 1934"". In that quake, which was of 8.0 magnitude and centred near Mount Everest, more than 10,000 people were reported killed. Kathmandu was all but destroyed.

In India, reports from across north India said people feared for their lives. Some of them began to pray and tried to get as far away as possible from buildings. Most ran to open grounds. Many of the high-rises saw people rush out in large numbers.

""Suddenly people started saying their heads were reeling, fans were shaking. Tables and chairs were shaking. As realisation dawned that it was an earthquake, people made a dash for the exit,"" said K. Chakraborty, an employee of a nationalised bank in Kolkata.

In Kochi, an employee said: ""Our office is on the seventh floor and close to 12 noon, I felt my pen moving on the table. I felt my chair was moving. I got up and saw my colleagues running.""

According to a Xinhua report from Beijing, the powerful earthquake that struck neighbouring Nepal has killed 12 people and injured many more in Tibet, southwest China.

It killed seven people in the county of Nyalam and five people in the county of Gyirong, authorities said. Both the counties in Xigaze are about 40 km from the epicentre.

KATHMANDU, Nepal — A top Nepalese police official says at least 876 people are confirmed dead in the wake of the massive earthquake that struck outside Kathmandu.

Deputy Inspector General of Police Komal Singh Bam says that the death toll is expected to rise following Saturday’s quake.

The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.8 struck before noon and was most severely felt in the capital as well as the densely populated Kathmandu Valley. A magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit about an hour later, and smaller aftershocks continued to ripple through the region for hours.

Beijing acted quickly yesterday to evacuate Chinese tourists stranded in Kathmandu, with roughly 1,000 expected to have flown home yesterday amid reports that some carriers had raised ticket prices.

State television reported that the nationals would be flown home on nine passenger flights, including two chartered ones, with a total capacity of about 1,100 seats.

At the request of the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu, China Southern Airlines sent an extra aircraft yesterday to pick up the tourists.

Embassy staff were also at the airport in the Nepalese capital to help Chinese tourists secure flights, intervening after at least one Chinese carrier allegedly ramped up ticket prices.

""Some airlines have lifted the price of a ticket to 13,000 yuan (HK$16,500). Cashing in on another country's disaster seriously tarnishes our national image,"" embassy military attache Senior Colonel Liu Xiaoguang was quoted by the Sohu news portal as saying. ""I want to smack them.""

A one-way ticket for the same route in two weeks' time costs about 2,500 yuan on various travel websites. Most tickets from Kathmandu to Guangzhou were sold out and the lowest price, offered by China Southern, was nearly 8,000 yuan yesterday.

A 23-year-old woman from Zhejiang province said she and four people she was travelling with were waiting at their hotel after trying to find a flight out of Kathmandu yesterday.

""The ticket price was ridiculously high, and we can't afford 8,000 yuan for a ticket, so we are waiting,"" she told the South China Morning Post.

Liu advised mainland visitors stranded at the airport not to buy overpriced tickets, and those who had already bought them to tell the embassy because ""the embassy and government will follow up seriously"", Sohu reported.

Liu told the Chinese military's online news outlet late yesterday that the embassy helped about 1,000 nationals return home, and more than 600 were still at the airport. About 1,000 more Chinese visitors were on their way to the airport.

One tourist told state-run CCTV that there was panic when the quake struck ""but here we are getting on board a flight back home within 24 hours"". ""It makes me feel fortunate to be Chinese,"" she said.

In Beijing, Foreign Minister Wang Yi called an emergency meeting with various departments yesterday, pledging to help Chinese nationals get home and to support relief efforts in the quake's aftermath.

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is preparing emergency relief materials and will send the supplies to quake-hit Nepal soon, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said late Saturday.

China International Search & Rescue Team (CISAR) will leave for Nepal Sunday morning to help with relief work in Nepal after the country was hit by a 8.1- magnitude earthquake earlier Saturday, Hong Lei said in a written statement.

More than 900 people, including 256 in the capital of Kathmandu, have been killed in the earthquake, which jolted large parts of Nepal as well as eastern India and Bangladesh on Saturday.

Some counties in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region was also affected by the strong earthquake.

China follows closely the developments of the earthquake in Nepal and conveys great concern and sympathy to the Nepalese people, said Hong.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and Foreign Minister Wang Yi have respectively sent messages of condolences to Nepalese President Ram Baran Yadav, Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mahendra Bahadur Pande, according to Hong.

In the messages, they expressed profound condolences to the deceased and deep sympathy to the bereaved families and the injured.

The Chinese government also extended solicitude to other countries affected by the earthquake, including India, Bangladesh and Bhutan, said Hong, adding that China is ready to provide assistance to these countries within its capacity.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese embassy in Nepal have launched emergency response mechanism to help with the Chinese nationals who have been injured in the disaster and deal with the aftermath of the deceased, adding that the Chinese diplomatic missions will also coordinate China's relief operations in Nepal.

GOAL has dispatched an emergency response team to Nepal to support relief efforts following the worst earthquake to hit the country in 80 years.

The 7.9-magnitute quake, which struck earlier today less than 50 miles from the capital, Kathmandu, and has destroyed homes, temples and other buildings.

Almost 1,500 people are already confirmed dead, with many more trapped, missing and seriously injured.

GOAL CEO, Barry Andrews, said: ""We have spoken with local agencies on the ground who have confirmed that hospitals are overrun and that huge numbers of people have been left homeless and are sleeping rough.

""Recovery teams are continuing to search desperately for survivors trapped in the rubble, a task that has been compounded by the fact that the entire city is without electricity.

""We have also received reports that a large number of villages on the outskirts of the capital have been completely flattened. Unfortunately, we are expecting the numbers of dead and injured to rise significantly in the coming hours.”

Deaths have also been reported on Mount Everest, and in India, China, Bangladesh and Tibet.

Oxfam Ireland has launched an emergency appeal and their team in Nepal is assessing what is needed.

Also, a team of technical experts is preparing to travel to Nepal with supplies of clean water, shelter, sanitation and emergency food.

Oxfam Ireland Chief Executive Jim Clarken said: “Unfortunately, we know that the death toll is set to rise significantly. There are reports of people still trapped in the rubble, with over 1,000 people killed so far and many more injured. Many poor and vulnerable people are homeless and without shelter.

“At present only reports from Kathmandu and nearby towns are available, so the exact numbers of those killed or injured will not become clear until aid workers can reach other areas. The relief teams’ work is hampered by the avalanches and landslides which have affected road access. Helicopter access has also proven difficult.”

Cecilia Keizer, Oxfam country director in Nepal said: “Communication is currently very difficult. Telephone lines are down and the electricity has been cut off. The water is also cut off. The number of people killed is continuing to rise.

“Many of the old houses have been destroyed and at least one large apartment block has come down in Kathmandu. Given the closeness to the epicentre Pokhara must also be badly affected. People are gathered in their thousands in open spaces and are scared as there have been many aftershocks”.

Jim Clarken added: “The scene is one of utter devastation, according to colleagues on the ground. It’s now a race against time to save lives and to get help to the communities overwhelmed by tragedy on a massive scale.”

Oxfam Ireland has launched an emergency appeal and is asking the Irish public to give what they can to fund the disaster response by donating online at www.oxfamireland.org, by phone on 1850 30 40 55 or at their local Oxfam shop.

Panicked families of Irish citizens caught up in quake-hit Nepal were last night still desperately waiting to hear from them.

More than 2,000 people are believed to have perished after a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck the Kathmandu area of Nepal on Saturday.

But that death toll is expected to grow when the true extent of the horror is known.

A total 100 Irish travellers are in the disaster-hit region near the Himalayan Mountain range and while most have been reported safe and well, the Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed that it has been unable to establish contact with every single Irish citizen in the devastated region.

Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan said: “Communications lines have been affected so this is an ongoing process that may take some time.

“We will continue to provide consular advice and assistance over the coming days as the situation evolves.”

Minister Flanagan said the government is working closely with the UN on how Ireland can best assist in the coming days.

He added: “An emergency Consular Response Team was established in my Department and will remain in place for as long as necessary to assist citizens who may be affected and their families.

“The Department is aware of some 50 citizens in the affected region. Contact has already been established with many of them.

“Our Consular Response Team in Dublin is liaising closely with our team at the Embassy of Ireland in New Delhi which is accredited to Nepal.”

Irish priest Fr Tom Dalton, 45, is among a group of nine hillwalkers from Courtown, Co Wexford who miraculously survived the horrifying quake.

Fr Dalton told his sister Joan at home in Wexford that the group was “very lucky” to escape injury.

He said they were now trying to get a flight home, but all the airports have been closed because of the earthquake.

And Ian Taylor, and Irish professional climber who escorts mountaineers and trekkers to the Himalayas, described how buildings collapsed around him.

He revealed: “I was sitting in the hotel lobby. We could barely get to open ground when it struck. I had two terrified people hanging off me. The hotel shook violently. I watched as two buildings crashed to the ground.”

International charities and volunteers are expected to arrive in Nepal on Monday.

Irish aid agency GOAL has dispatched an emergency response team to support relief efforts.

GOAL chief Barry Andrews said last night: “We have spoken with local agencies on the ground who have confirmed that hospitals are overrun and that huge numbers of people have been left homeless and are sleeping rough.

“Recovery teams are continuing to search desperately for survivors trapped in the rubble, a task that has been compounded by the fact that the entire city is without electricity.

“We have also received reports that a large number of villages on the outskirts of the capital have been completely flattened. Unfortunately, we are expecting the numbers of dead and injured to rise significantly in the coming hours.”

Nepal bore the brunt of the quake’s impact with some 2,000 dead and more than 5,000 injured and the toll is expected to climb as more reports come in from far-flung areas.

Among the dead are at least 17 who were struck by a quake-triggered avalanche on Mount Everest that buried part of the base camp packed with foreigners at the end of the climbing season.

The magnitude 7.8 earthquake, which originated outside the capital Kathmandu, was the worst to hit the poor Himalayan nation in over 80 years.

It destroyed the historic part of the city and was strong enough to be felt across the northern part of neighbouring India, Bangladesh, China’s region of Tibet and Pakistan, where a total of 60 people died.

Local Sundar Sah revealed: “There were at least three big quakes at night and early morning. How can we feel safe? This is never-ending and everyone is scared and worried.

“I hardly got much sleep. I was waking up every few hours and glad that I was alive.”

Anyone who is concerned about Irish family or friends in the region can contact the Department on 01 418 0200.

""Three Air India flights and some Indigo are ready to take off but the Air Traffic Control in Kathmandu is closed. Once the ATC resumes operations these aircraft will start flying there,"" Sharma told.

When asked about international flights bound for Kathmandu being diverted to India, Sharma said the flights are being diverted to Delhi and some other airports close to the Nepal capital.

Asked whether stranded Indians would be rescued via roads, Sharma said that option would also explored.

Two Indian Air Force aircraft on Saturday night brought back 155 Indians, including four infants, from earthquake-hit Nepal.

The aircraft C-130J, which had earlier flown National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) members and relief materials from New Delhi to Kathmandu, landed in New Delhi with the first batch of 55 Indian evacuees at around 10.45pm, a defence ministry spokesperson said.

The second batch of 100 Indians arrived in IAF's C-17 aircraft landed at Palam airport at around 0020 hours, officials said.

Ministry of external affairs tweeted that two more batches were expected overnight on Saturday.

#NepalEarthquake update A fourth aircraft with 160 is expected to leave Kathmandu by about 1 am tonight. More flights planned for tomorrow. — Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) April 25, 2015

India had sent C-130J, IL-76 and C-17 planes to Kathmandu to ferry Indian nationals stuck in the Nepalese capital.

The IL-76 plane had flown 153 NDRF members along with 28 tonnes of relief material to Kathmanadu while the C-17 aircraft had carried 96 NDRF members with 15 tonnes of relief material.

Nepal was struck by the worst earthquake in 80 years, leaving nearly 1,500 people dead in flattened houses and buildings.

The quake measuring 7.9 on Richter scale, which was followed by 16 aftershocks of magnitude 4.5 or greater, striking heavy casualties in Kathmandu and injuring thousand others. Hundreds were feared missing across the country.

Kathmandu/New Delhi : Over 1,500 people were killed and thousands were injured when a massive earthquake – lasting about 20 frightening seconds – and several strong aftershocks caused widespread destruction in Nepal. India too was affected.

In Nepal, buildings were flattened, roads cracked, telephone connectivity snapped and hospitals grappled with a large number of injured who were extricated from the rubble after the country was hit by the temblor at 11.41 a.m. India time.

The quake measured 7.9 on the Richter scale. The epicentre was Nepal’s Lamjung district, some 75 km northwest of capital Kathmandu. Over 50 aftershocks were also felt.

According to Nepal’s Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat, at least 1,570 people have died in the disaster.

Citing the Nepal Army, he told reporters that 1,457 bodies have been recovered from various quake-hit sites while 1,055 people were injured.

In Sindhupalchowk district, over 250 were killed.

In Kathmandu alone, 181 people were killed, in Bhaktapur 144, and in Lalitpur district 88. Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur together form Nepal’s capital.

Indian Home Secretary L.C. Goel told the media that 34 people were killed in India. There were 23 dead in Bihar, three were killed in West Bengal while eight people died in Uttar Pradesh.

The tremors were felt across India, right from Srinagar to Kochi, and Jaipur to Guwahati.

At least two Indians have died in Nepal.

“I can confirm only two Indian deaths now — one in the embassy and one in a hospital,” Ambassador Rae said.

Asked about other Indian casualties, he said it was difficult to give exact figures as the phone lines were down and it was tough to contact the proper authorities.

He said the embassy was in touch with some Indians stranded in Muktinath and Jomsom, adding that embassy officials have been dispatched to hotels and hospitals.

The ambassador said that around 250 Indians were being evacuated on Saturday night.

Kathmandu, which is a much sought after tourist destination, bore the brunt of the devastation. People watched in disbelief as a number of its old buildings, including the Dharahara – a nine-storey 19th-century tower – collapsed. There was also damage to the walls surrounding Nepal’s royal palace.

The revered Pashupatinath temple did not appear to have suffered any major damage.

Ten mountaineers were killed at the Mount Everest Base Camp when the temblor triggered an avalanche, an official at the Nepal tourism ministry said.

The earth heaved and panic-stricken people rushed out of their homes and offices.

IANS correspondent Anil Giri, who is based in Kathmandu, spoke of the horror.

He said over 1,000 buildings in Kathmandu have been destroyed, including historical structures. Thousands of people were out in the open. Electricity has been cut-off and wi-fi services are down. Hospitals are packed with the injured and the army is out in full force to help rescue people.

Kathmandu is a warren of tightly packed houses and narrow streets and these were filled with wailing people who panicked further as aftershocks rocked the area.

A young woman, who clutched a blood soaked handkerchief to her forehead, cried and said that she was worried about her family. She said that she did not get the time to safely escape from her home which came crashing down. “I was terrified,” she said at a hospital here.

A former Nepal minister said there had been “massive damage” at the epicentre Lamjung.

Sadbhavana Party chief Rajendra Mahto told IANS that it was difficult to estimate the loss so soon after the disaster but Kathmandu and its neighbourhood had suffered a lot of damage.

“We will need support from neighbours, especially India, and international agencies…,” said Mahto, who was a member of the first Constituent Assembly and a minister in several administrations.

The Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu was indefinitely shut on Saturday, resulting in the cancellation of all the eight subsequent return flights from India bound for the capital city.

The airport, according to aviation officials in Delhi, was opened in the evening, but only for non-commercial and relief operations. Some airlines like SpiceJet said they had been asked by Indian authorities to keep an aircraft ready to lift supplies from here and bring back stranded passengers.

Soon after the quake struck, an IndiGo flight for Nepal, which had left at 11:30 a.m. from New Delhi, had to be recalled and the departures of two others were suspended, official here said. The flight of Nepalese carrier Buddha Air, bound for Varanasi, was among the eight flights that were called off.

The daughter of an employee of the Indian embassy was killed when a building in the embassy complex in Kathmandu collapsed.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi promptly directed dispatch of relief and rescue teams, including medical help to Nepal, as well as to the affected areas in India.

He chaired a high-level meeting to review the situation.

Modi spoke to Nepal President Ram Baran Yadav and Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who was abroad, and assured all assistance. He also spoke to the chief ministers of affected states in India like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Sikkim and Madhya Pradesh.

A meeting of the Nepal cabinet was held in the evening. It termed the earthquake a national crisis and sought international help.

India has sent two plane loads of relief material and rescue personnel to Nepal. The planes carried 45 rescue personnel and some sniffer dogs to help in rescue operations.

An air force spokesperson said that the Kathmandu airport runway was intact and aircraft could land there. All civilian flights have been cancelled.

Images showed that the quake had left the people of Nepal stunned. Besides capital Kathmandu and Besisahar in Lamjung, the cities which were affected include Bharatpur, Pokhara and Kirtipur.

Indian Ambassador Ranjit Rae told IANS that “the old towns in the Kathmandu Valley have been affected in the earthquake”.

Witnesses said this appeared to be “the most massive earthquake to hit central Nepal since 1934”. In that quake, which was of 8.0 magnitude and centred near Mount Everest, more than 10,000 people were reported killed. Kathmandu was all but destroyed.

In India, reports from across north India said people feared for their lives. Some of them began to pray and tried to get as far away as possible from buildings. Most ran to open grounds. Many of the high-rises saw people rush out in large numbers.

“Suddenly people started saying their heads were reeling, fans were shaking. Tables and chairs were shaking. As realisation dawned that it was an earthquake, people made a dash for the exit,” said K. Chakraborty, an employee of a nationalised bank in Kolkata.

In Kochi, an employee said: “Our office is on the seventh floor and close to 12 noon, I felt my pen moving on the table. I felt my chair was moving. I got up and saw my colleagues running.”

According to a Xinhua report from Beijing, the powerful earthquake that struck neighbouring Nepal has killed 12 people and injured many more in Tibet, southwest China.

It killed seven people in the county of Nyalam and five people in the county of Gyirong, authorities said. Both the counties in Xigaze are about 40 km from the epicentre.

KATHMANDU: A powerful earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday, killing at least 1,180 people across a swath of four countries as the violently shaking earth collapsed houses, leveled centuries-old temples and triggered avalanches on Mount Everest.

It was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years. At least 1,130 people were confirmed dead across Nepal, according to the police. Another 34 were killed in India, 12 in Tibet and two in Bangladesh. Two Chinese citizens died on the Nepal-China border. The death toll is almost certain to rise, said deputy Inspector General of Police Komal Singh Bam.

It was a few minutes before noon when the quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 7.8, began to rumble across the densely populated Kathmandu Valley, rippling through the capital Kathmandu and spreading in all directions — north toward the Himalayas and Tibet, south to the Indo-Gangetic plains, east toward the Brahmaputra delta of Bangladesh and west toward the historical city of Lahore in Pakistan.

Shrish Vaidya, a businessman, was with his family in his two-story house on the outskirts of Kathmandu, when the quake struck. “It is hard to describe. The house was shaking like crazy. We ran out and it seemed like the road was heaving up and down,” he said. “I don't remember anything like this before. Even my parents can't remember anything this bad.”

Officials said an avalanche had buried parts of Mount Everest's base camp in Nepal where hundreds of mountaineers have gathered at the start of the annual climbing season.

“An avalanche from Mt. Pumori has hit the base camp, burying a part of it, “Gyanendra Kumar Shrestha, an official in Nepal's tourism department, told AFP.

“We are trying to assess how many are injured. There might be over 1,000 people there right now, including foreign climbers and Nepalese supporting staff.""

AFP Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly, on an assignment to Everest, was among those caught up in the chaos and reported that snowfall meant it was impossible for helicopters to reach the area.

Two experienced mountaineers said that panic erupted at base camp which was full of climbing teams and had been “severely damaged”, while one said the quake triggered a “huge avalanche”.

International aid groups rushed to respond Saturday to a massive earthquake in Nepal that claimed more than 1,000 lives as aftershocks and severed communications hampered rescue efforts.

“We do not yet know the scope of the damage, but this could be one of the deadliest and most devastating earthquakes since the 1934 tremor which devastated Nepal and Bihar,” said Jagan Chapagain, Asia/Pacific director of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

The IFCR said it was extremely concerned about the fate of rural villages close to the epicentre of the quake, some 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the capital Kathmandu.

“Roads have been damaged or blocked by landslides and communication lines are down preventing us from reaching local Red Cross branches to get accurate information,” said Chapagain in a statement.

Historic tower collapses

The worst damage was reported in Kathmandu, where the historic nine-storey Dharahara tower, a major tourist attraction, was among the buildings to have been brought down.

At least a dozen bodies were taken away from the ruins of the 19th century tower, according to an AFP photographer who saw similar scenes of multiple casualties in other parts of the city.

While contact with Nepal was sporadic, a senior Nepalese diplomat warned that the final toll could run into many hundreds.

“We have received reports that there is a big loss of property and life in Nepal,” Krishna Prasad Dhakal, the deputy chief of mission at Nepal's Embassy in New Delhi, told AFP.

“Possibly hundreds of people have died in various parts of the country, particularly in Kathmandu and Pokhara.""

At least 26 people were known to have died in India, including 17 in the eastern state of Bihar, while buildings in the capital New Delhi had to be evacuated.

The United States Geological Survey and India's meteorological service said the shallow quake struck 77 kilometres (48 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 0611 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside their homes.

“The walls of houses have collapsed around me onto the road. All the families are outside in their yards huddled together,” an AFP reporter said in Kathmandu.

Another resident recounted scenes of panic and mayhem.

“Everything started shaking. Everything fell down. The walls around the main road have collapsed. The national stadium's gates have collapsed,” Anupa Shrestha said.

The quake tore through the middle of highways in the capital and also caused damage to the country's only international airport which was briefly closed.

Kari Cuelenaere, an official at the Dutch embassy, said the impact had swept the water out of a swimming pool at a Kathmandu hotel where Dutch national day was being celebrated.

“It was horrible, all of a sudden all the water came up out of the pool and drenched everyone, the children started screaming,” Cuelenaere told AFP. “Some parts of the city fell down, there was dust rising... There were many (rescue) helicopters.

Aftershock tremors could be felt more than two hours after the initial quake.

Initially measured at 7.5 magnitude, the quake was later adjusted to 7.8, with a depth of 15 kilometres, the USGS said. It hit 73 kilometres east of the tourist town of Pokhara.

US sending disaster response team

The United States is sending a disaster response team to earthquake-hit Nepal and has authorised an initial $1 million to address immediate needs, the US Agency for International Development said Saturday.

The agency “is launching a DART team to respond to the #NepalQuake and has authorised an initial $1m to address immediate needs,” the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance chief Jeremy Konyndyk said on Twitter.

Tremors felt across region

Witnesses and media reports said the tremors lasted between 30 seconds and two minutes.

“We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet.

The AFP office in Delhi was evacuated twice following the quake.

China's official Xinhua news agency said that two people, including an 83-year-old woman, were killed in the Tibet region as a result of the quake.

The earthquake was also felt across large areas of Bangladesh, triggering panic in the capital Dhaka as people rushed out onto the streets.

In the garment manufacturing hub of Savar, on the outskirts of Dhaka, at least 50 workers were injured after the quake set off a stampede in a garment factory, according to the private Jamuna television.

The area has a history of earthquakes, with a 6.8 magnitude quake that hit eastern Nepal in August 1988 killing 721 people.

A magnitude 8.1 quake killed 10,700 people in Nepal and eastern India in 1934.

Pakistan offers assistance to Nepal and India

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who is in London on an official visit, has expressed his ""deep shock on the reports of a massive earthquake that has caused devastation in Nepal and Northern India this morning"", said a statement issued by the foreign office.

The statement also said, ""the Government of Pakistan and its people extend their heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the governments and the peoples of Nepal and India on the tragedy that has caused loss of precious lives and properties"".

According to the statement, the government of Pakistan has instructed its missions in the two countries to approach their respective host governments to ascertain the damages caused and the requirement of relief assistance.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) of Pakistan has been readied to take the relief assistance at a short notice, the statement said.

SHOCKING aerial photos show villages turned to rubble after Nepal’s monster earthquake, as rescuers dig through debris in Kathmandu.

Former Nepalese Prime Minister Dr Baburam Bhattarai shared images on Facebook of homes in the Gorkha region demolished after Saturday’s 7.8-magnitude earthquake.

Officials said more than 2500 people have died, possibly including one Australian, and more than 6200 were injured after the quake tore through large parts of Nepal, levelling homes, toppling office blocks and triggering deadly avalanches at Everest base camp.

The death toll in India stands at 67, while Chinese officials say 18 people had been killed in the Tibet region.

As rescuers sift through the rubble searching for survivors, grief-stricken Nepalese are holding mass cremations in the devastated capital.

The horrific quake, the Himalayan nation’s worst disaster in more than 80 years, was followed by powerful aftershocks, including a including a 6.7 magnitude monster on Sunday.

The US Geological Survey reports the shock, which occurred in the Kathmandu region, registered at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres.

There are still grave fears for the safety of dozens of Australians travelling in Nepal.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said there were more than 500 Australians registered as travelling in Nepal, with the safety of 200 confirmed.

AFP correspondents in Kathmandu reported that tremors were felt throughout the night, including one strong aftershock at dawn.

AFP’s Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly, on an assignment at base camp, reported that six helicopters had managed to reach the mountain on Sunday morning after the weather had improved overnight.

Hospitals were so stretched on Sunday that medics had set up tents outside the buildings to treat patients.

Snowfalls on Saturday had thwarted efforts to airlift survivors from Everest base camp, where hundreds of mountaineers were gathered at the start of the annual climbing season, cancelled last year after the deaths of the 16 sherpa guides.

Offers of help have poured in from governments around the world, with the US and European Union announcing they were sending in disaster response teams. India flew out its stranded citizens in military planes.

“We have deployed all our resources for search and rescues,” Singh Bam said.

“Helicopters have been sent to remote areas. We are sifting through the rubble where buildings have collapsed to see if we can find anyone.”

The European Commission has released three million euros ($4.2 million) in emergency aid for Nepal, is in addition to assistance offered by individual EU nations and the deployment of European Commission humanitarian aid and civil protection experts to the crisis area.

“The commission’s emergency aid will go towards the most urgent needs in the worst affected areas, including clean water, medicine, emergency shelter and telecommunications,” the EU’s executive arm said in a statement on Sunday.

“I have mobilised all our means for emergency response to help the survivors and authorities in the aftermath of this tragedy. What is needed most are medical teams and relief supplies. I call on all EU member states to join the co-ordinated European response,” EU Commissioner for Crisis Management Christos Stylianides said.

The EU Civil Protection Mechanism has been activated, via which member states including Belgium, Finland, Germany, Greece, Netherlands, Poland and Sweden immediately offered search and rescue teams, water purification systems and technical assistance.

Other member states have also expressed their willingness to help, the commission statement said.

Google confirmed his death. Lawrence You, the company’s director of privacy, posted online that Fredinburg was in Nepal with three other Google employees climbing Mount Everest.

The other three, he added, are safe. Google would not give further details.

Earlier, a Romanian mountaineer at Everest posted that many “badly injured” people caught in the avalanche could die unless helicopters arrived soon.

HOW BAD IS THE DAMAGE?

The magnitude-7.8 quake was the worst to hit Nepal in eight decades and caused damage and fatalities in neighbouring countries as well.

The earthquake hit a heavily populated area of Nepal, including the capital, Kathmandu, and its impact spread far beyond the Kathmandu Valley.

Earthquake experts are preparing for high numbers in terms of deaths and damage.

“This is a very large earthquake in a significantly populated region with infrastructure that has been damaged in past earthquakes,” U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. “Significant fatalities are expected.”

Local hospitals were already filling with injured residents, and Kathmandu’s international airport was shut down, hampering initial relief efforts in the isolated mountainous country.

media_camera Heavy toll ... some 1,900 people are confirmed dead and thousands more seriously injured. Picture: AP photo

WHAT HAPPENED? AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

Seismologist Earle said the quake happened on what is known as a “thrust fault.” That describes the situation when one piece of the Earth’s crust is moving beneath another piece.

In this case, it’s the Indian Plate that is moving north at 45 millimetres (1.7 inches) a year under the Eurasian Plate to the north, Earle said. It’s a different type of earthquake than the one that caused the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

“This is what builds the Himalayan mountain range,” Earle said.

The region and particular fault has a history of damaging earthquakes, including four temblors with magnitudes greater than 6.0 in the past 100 years, Earle said, warning that landslides are a particular worry now, given the steep slopes in the region.

WHAT DOES ‘RED ALERT’ ISSUED BY US OFFICIALS MEAN?

The US Geological Survey said the earthquake was strong enough to merit a “red alert” for shaking-related fatalities and economic losses. It said that “high casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread. Past red alerts have required a national or international response.”

Quick USGS calculations estimate a two-thirds likelihood of between 1000 and 100,000 fatalities and damage between $100 million and $10 billion. Scientists estimate that more than 105 million people felt at least moderate shaking during the quake.

(Reuters) — A powerful earthquake struck Nepal and sent tremors through northern India on Saturday, killing hundreds of people, toppling a 19th-century tower in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu and triggering a fatal avalanche on Mount Everest.

There were reports of devastation in outlying areas of the Himalayan country after the quake struck with a magnitude of 7.9, its epicenter 50 miles (80 km) east of Nepal’s second largest city, Pokhara.

Around 300,000 foreign tourists were estimated to be in various parts of Nepal for the spring trekking and climbing season in the Himalayas, and officials were overwhelmed by calls from concerned friends and relatives.

There was no immediate word on American or Israeli casualties. Nepal is a popular destination for Israeli tourists, especially young backpackers, and mountain climbers.

An Israel foreign ministry spokesman said embassy staff in Kathmandu were seeking to assess the situation.

The worst quake to hit the impoverished Himalayan nation in 81 years also caused damage in neighboring Indian states and Bangladesh. The quake was shallow, intensifying the amount of energy released over a relatively small area.

A police spokesman said the death toll had reached 900 in Nepal according to an initial estimate, most from the Kathmandu Valley. There was little information coming from the outlying areas of the mountainous country and helicopters were circling overheard to get a better sense of the damage.

“Hundreds of people are feared dead and there are reports of widespread damage to property. The devastation is not confined to some areas of Nepal. Almost the entire country has been hit,” said Krishna Prasad Dhakal, deputy chief of mission at Nepal’s Embassy in New Delhi.

A tourism official said eight people were killed by an avalanche unleashed by the earthquake that swept through the Everest Base Camp for climbers of the world’s highest mountain.

“The toll could go up, it may include foreigners as well as sherpas,” Gyanendra Shrestha said.

A collapse in communications was hampering efforts to launch relief efforts across Nepal’s rugged terrain.

“We are totally cut off from most parts of our country,” said Ram Narayan Pandey of the Nepal Disaster Management Authority, who was coordinating relief efforts from Kathmandu.

A 1934 quake of magnitude 8.3 in Nepal killed over 8,500 people.

The death toll in northern India rose to at least 12, with six killed in house collapses in Uttar Pradesh and six more dying in Bihar further east, according to government officials. One person died in Bangladesh.

TOWER TOPPLED

A 19th century tower collapsed in Kathmandu when the quake struck shortly before noon local time. A policeman said that up to 200 people had been trapped there.

The Dharara Tower, built in 1832, was a landmark that had been open to visitors for the last 10 years and had a viewing balcony.

A stump just 10 meters (33 feet) high was all that was left of the 14-story structure. Several bodies were brought away from the ruins.

At the main hospital in Kathmandu, people with broken limbs and arms were being rushed in for treatment. Crowds and volunteers formed human chains to clear the way for ambulances to bring in the injured.

“There are people everyone where in the corridors and out in the field,” said a Reuters reporter.

Television news footage showed people being treated on the streets outside hospitals and several bodies lying in rows, covered in blankets.

Kathmandu is home to ancient, wooden Hindu temples. Photographs posted online showed buildings reduced to rubble, with large cracks along roads and residents sitting in the street holding babies.

EVEREST AVALANCHE

The Everest avalanches, first reported by climbers, raised fears for those on the world’s loftiest peak a year after a massive snowslide caused the deadliest incident yet there.

Romanian climber Alex Gavan said on Twitter that there had been a “huge avalanche” and “many, many” people were up on the mountain. “Running for life from my tent,” Gavan said. “Everest base camp huge earthquake then huge avalanche.”

Another climber, Daniel Mazur, said Everest base camp had been “severely damaged” and his team was trapped.

“Please pray for everyone,” he said on his Twitter page.

An avalanche in April 2014 just above the base camp on Mount Everest killed 16 Nepali guides. April is one of the most popular times to scale Everest before rain and clouds cloak the mountain at the end of next month.

FAR AND WIDE

Tremors were felt as far away as New Delhi and other northern cities in India, with reports that they had lasted up to a minute.

“Massive tremors have been felt here in Delhi and several other parts of India,” said a newsreader on NDTV in Delhi.

“You can see pictures of our Delhi studios, where the windows rattled and everything shook for a very long time, for a minute perhaps or longer,” she said as footage showed studio ceiling camera lights shaking.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake, initially measured at 7.7 but upgraded to 7.9 magnitude, struck 80 km (50 miles) east of Pokhara. It was only 2 km deep.

“We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal,” tweeted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

He convened a high-level meeting with ministers and top officials to assess the situation. There were no preliminary reports of damage anywhere in India, Home Minister Rajnath Singh told the Press Trust of India.

Kathmandu: A massive earthquake killed more than 1,200 people Saturday as it tore through large parts of Nepal, toppling office blocks and towers in Kathmandu and triggering a deadly avalanche at Everest base camp.

Officials said at least 1,170 people are known to have died in Nepal, making it the quake-prone Himalayan nation's worst disaster in more than 80 years.

But the final toll from the 7.8 magnitude quake could be much higher, and dozens more people were reported killed in neighbouring India and China.

""The death toll has reached 1,170,"" Nepal police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam told AFP, adding that rescue efforts were still underway.

Emergency workers fanned out across the Himalayan nation to rescue those trapped under collapsed homes, buildings and other debris.

Offers of help poured in from governments around the world, with the United States announcing it was sending in a disaster response team.

""Deaths have been reported from all regions except the far west. All our security personnel have been deployed to rescue and assist those in need,"" Bam told AFP.



Everest base camp avalanche kills 10



An avalanche at Mount Everest base camp triggered by a massive earthquake killed at least 10 people on Saturday, including foreign climbers, a Nepalese official said.

""We don't have the details yet, but 10 have been reported dead so far, including foreign climbers,"" Gyanendra Kumar Shrestha from Nepal's tourism department told AFP.



Hotlines set up

India's Ministry of External Affairs has set up hotlines to provide help and information round the clock.

The numbers to the 24-hour Control Room are +91 11 2301 2113, +91 11 2301 4104 and +91 11 2301 7905, an official statement said.

Devastation in Nepal

The 19th-century Dharara Tower was among several structures that collapsed, with several bodies seen at the site of the disaster, witnesses and television footage showed. Around a dozen bodies were taken away from the ruins, according to an AFP photographer at the scene.

Television footage showed that large numbers of offices and homes had collapsed in Kathmandu while roads had been split in two by the force of the impact. Dozens of people with injuries were being brought to the main hospital in central Kathmandu.

Panicked residents rushed into the streets as the tremor erupted around midday, with the impact felt hundreds of miles away in big swathes of northern India and even in Bangladesh. Families were see racing outside their homes.



""The walls of houses have collapsed around me onto the road. All the families are outside in their yards huddled together. The tremors are still going on,"" an AFP reporter said in Kathmandu.

Another resident recounted scenes of panic and mayhem.

""Everything started shaking. Everything fell down. The walls around the main road have collapsed. The national stadiums gates have collapsed,"" Kathmandu resident Anupa Shrestha said.

There were reports of avalanches in the Mount Everest region.

Casualties reported

One person was reportedly killed when an old building collapsed in the premises of the Indian consulate.

A girl died after a statue fell on her in a park in Kathmandu, a witness said, while another died in India when her house collapsed.

In Nepal's Pokhara area, police spokesman Kamal Singh Ban told the media that they have received information about the death of 10 people in the area.

The quake struck 81 kilometres northwest of Kathmandu before noon on Saturday, with walls crumbling and families racing outside of their homes in Nepal.

""The walls of houses have collapsed around me onto the road. All the families are outside in their yards huddled together. The tremors are still going on,"" an AFP reporter said in Kathmandu.

Several buildings collapsed in the centre of the capital, including centuries-old temples, said resident Prachanda Sual.

He said he saw people running through the streets in panic. Ambulance sirens blared and government helicopters hovered overhead.

National radio warned people to stay outdoors because more aftershocks are feared. It is also asking people to maintain calm.

Old Kathmandu city is a warren of tightly packed, narrow lanes with poorly constructed homes piled on top of each other.

Epicentre of quake

Nepal's Information Minister Minendra Rijal told India's NDTV station that rescue teams were on the scene in Kathmandu.

The epicentre was 80 kilometres northwest of Kathmandu, he said. The Kathmandu Valley is densely populated with nearly 2.5 million, with the quality of buildings often poor.

An Associated Press reporter in Kathmandu said a wall in his compound collapsed and there was damage to nearby buildings.

Initially measured at 7.5 magnitude, the quake was later adjusted to 7.9, with a depth of 15 kilometres, according to the United States Geological Survey.

Media reports said the quake tremors lasted between 30 seconds and two minutes and were felt across the across the border in Pakistan and India, including in the capital New Delhi and in the cities of Guwahati, Kolkata, Jaipur, Lucknow and Patna.

In Delhi, people were seen frantically rushing out of high-rise buildings as soon as the tremors were felt.

""We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal,"" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet. The AFP building in Delhi was evacuated twice following the quake, a correspondent said.

The quake was also felt in neighbouring Pakistan.

Mohammad Shahab, a resident from Lahore, Pakistan, said he was sitting in his office when the earthquake rocked the city near the border with India.

He said the tremors continued for a while but now the situation was normal.

KATHMANDU: A powerful earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday, killing at least 1,180 people across a swath of four countries as the violently shaking earth collapsed houses, leveled centuries-old temples and triggered avalanches on Mount Everest.

It was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years. At least 1,130 people were confirmed dead across Nepal, according to the police. Another 34 were killed in India, 12 in Tibet and two in Bangladesh. Two Chinese citizens died on the Nepal-China border. The death toll is almost certain to rise, said deputy Inspector General of Police Komal Singh Bam.

It was a few minutes before noon when the quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 7.8, began to rumble across the densely populated Kathmandu Valley, rippling through the capital Kathmandu and spreading in all directions — north toward the Himalayas and Tibet, south to the Indo-Gangetic plains, east toward the Brahmaputra delta of Bangladesh and west toward the historical city of Lahore in Pakistan.

Shrish Vaidya, a businessman, was with his family in his two-story house on the outskirts of Kathmandu, when the quake struck. “It is hard to describe. The house was shaking like crazy. We ran out and it seemed like the road was heaving up and down,” he said. “I don't remember anything like this before. Even my parents can't remember anything this bad.”

Officials said an avalanche had buried parts of Mount Everest's base camp in Nepal where hundreds of mountaineers have gathered at the start of the annual climbing season.

“An avalanche from Mt. Pumori has hit the base camp, burying a part of it, “Gyanendra Kumar Shrestha, an official in Nepal's tourism department, told AFP.

“We are trying to assess how many are injured. There might be over 1,000 people there right now, including foreign climbers and Nepalese supporting staff.""

AFP Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly, on an assignment to Everest, was among those caught up in the chaos and reported that snowfall meant it was impossible for helicopters to reach the area.

Two experienced mountaineers said that panic erupted at base camp which was full of climbing teams and had been “severely damaged”, while one said the quake triggered a “huge avalanche”.

International aid groups rushed to respond Saturday to a massive earthquake in Nepal that claimed more than 1,000 lives as aftershocks and severed communications hampered rescue efforts.

“We do not yet know the scope of the damage, but this could be one of the deadliest and most devastating earthquakes since the 1934 tremor which devastated Nepal and Bihar,” said Jagan Chapagain, Asia/Pacific director of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

The IFCR said it was extremely concerned about the fate of rural villages close to the epicentre of the quake, some 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the capital Kathmandu.

“Roads have been damaged or blocked by landslides and communication lines are down preventing us from reaching local Red Cross branches to get accurate information,” said Chapagain in a statement.

Historic tower collapses

The worst damage was reported in Kathmandu, where the historic nine-storey Dharahara tower, a major tourist attraction, was among the buildings to have been brought down.

At least a dozen bodies were taken away from the ruins of the 19th century tower, according to an AFP photographer who saw similar scenes of multiple casualties in other parts of the city.

While contact with Nepal was sporadic, a senior Nepalese diplomat warned that the final toll could run into many hundreds.

“We have received reports that there is a big loss of property and life in Nepal,” Krishna Prasad Dhakal, the deputy chief of mission at Nepal's Embassy in New Delhi, told AFP.

“Possibly hundreds of people have died in various parts of the country, particularly in Kathmandu and Pokhara.""

At least 26 people were known to have died in India, including 17 in the eastern state of Bihar, while buildings in the capital New Delhi had to be evacuated.

The United States Geological Survey and India's meteorological service said the shallow quake struck 77 kilometres (48 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 0611 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside their homes.

“The walls of houses have collapsed around me onto the road. All the families are outside in their yards huddled together,” an AFP reporter said in Kathmandu.

Another resident recounted scenes of panic and mayhem.

“Everything started shaking. Everything fell down. The walls around the main road have collapsed. The national stadium's gates have collapsed,” Anupa Shrestha said.

The quake tore through the middle of highways in the capital and also caused damage to the country's only international airport which was briefly closed.

Kari Cuelenaere, an official at the Dutch embassy, said the impact had swept the water out of a swimming pool at a Kathmandu hotel where Dutch national day was being celebrated.

“It was horrible, all of a sudden all the water came up out of the pool and drenched everyone, the children started screaming,” Cuelenaere told AFP. “Some parts of the city fell down, there was dust rising... There were many (rescue) helicopters.

Aftershock tremors could be felt more than two hours after the initial quake.

Initially measured at 7.5 magnitude, the quake was later adjusted to 7.8, with a depth of 15 kilometres, the USGS said. It hit 73 kilometres east of the tourist town of Pokhara.

US sending disaster response team

The United States is sending a disaster response team to earthquake-hit Nepal and has authorised an initial $1 million to address immediate needs, the US Agency for International Development said Saturday.

The agency “is launching a DART team to respond to the #NepalQuake and has authorised an initial $1m to address immediate needs,” the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance chief Jeremy Konyndyk said on Twitter.

Tremors felt across region

Witnesses and media reports said the tremors lasted between 30 seconds and two minutes.

“We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet.

The AFP office in Delhi was evacuated twice following the quake.

China's official Xinhua news agency said that two people, including an 83-year-old woman, were killed in the Tibet region as a result of the quake.

The earthquake was also felt across large areas of Bangladesh, triggering panic in the capital Dhaka as people rushed out onto the streets.

In the garment manufacturing hub of Savar, on the outskirts of Dhaka, at least 50 workers were injured after the quake set off a stampede in a garment factory, according to the private Jamuna television.

The area has a history of earthquakes, with a 6.8 magnitude quake that hit eastern Nepal in August 1988 killing 721 people.

A magnitude 8.1 quake killed 10,700 people in Nepal and eastern India in 1934.

Pakistan offers assistance to Nepal and India

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who is in London on an official visit, has expressed his ""deep shock on the reports of a massive earthquake that has caused devastation in Nepal and Northern India this morning"", said a statement issued by the foreign office.

The statement also said, ""the Government of Pakistan and its people extend their heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the governments and the peoples of Nepal and India on the tragedy that has caused loss of precious lives and properties"".

According to the statement, the government of Pakistan has instructed its missions in the two countries to approach their respective host governments to ascertain the damages caused and the requirement of relief assistance.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) of Pakistan has been readied to take the relief assistance at a short notice, the statement said.

New Delhi/ Kathmandu | Atleast 700 people were killed in Nepal and 24 in various parts of India as a powerful earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale rocked the two South Asian countries, resulting in a massive loss of life and property.

Deputy Chief of Mission at the Nepal Embassy in New Delhi Krishna Prasad Dhakal said the death toll in his country could cross the 500-mark. Most of the fatalities have been reported from the Kathmandu valley though there is little information pouring in from outlying areas of the region.

In India, 36 people died in collapsed buildings, six in Uttar Pradesh, 16 in Bihar and at least two in West Bengal.

The intensity was severest in Nepal where the epicenter was reported while its intensity was a bit low in India but areas of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, bordering Nepal, were also hit badly.

With the tremblor leaving a trail of death and destruction in the Himalayan nation, local TV channels were showing heaps of bodies even as the authorities launched a massive rescue and relief operation. Chaotic scenes were witnessed outside hospitals where wailing relatives were seen searching their kith and kin.

Reports quoting Nepal police said at least 450 were feared dead and fifty bodies can be counted in a local hospital in Kathmandu. Every minute the toll is rising as rescuers with bare hands were trying to rescue trapped persons. No official figure of the death toll is available so far, but channels and various sources are compiling figures and say at least 150 feared dead besides scores of others were left injured. Many of the injured reported to hospitals with broken limbs and bleeding wounds.

Reports received from Kathmandu said casualty figures may be many times higher as several buildings had flattened with people feared buried under the debris. Hospitals were flooded with injured. Access to many lanes and by-lanes in the capital city of Kathmandu has been blocked due to huge mound of debris.

Relief and rescue operations have been launched to save people trapped in collapsed buildings and historical monuments and temples. Doctors have pitched camps on streets of Kathmandu to give first aid to the injured.

In Nepals Lamjung, the epicentre of the quake, many buildings have been flattened. There are reports of cracks developing at the Kathmandu airport. Flights have been diverted to India.

Eyewitnesses said Dharahara Tower/Bhimsen Tower, a 19th century nine-storey tall tower in Kathmandu, has collapsed. About 400 people are believed to be trapped.

Yoga guru Baba Ramdev, who is currently in Kathmandu, said he heard a major explosion like sound soon after the quake and at least five aftershocks have been felt .

Prime Minister Narendra Modi held an emergency meeting to review the situation arising from the quake in India and how New Delhi could assist Nepal in its hour of crisis. He also spoke to Nepal Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who is in transit in Bangkok on his way to Kathmandu.

KATHMANDU: A massive earthquake killed more than 1,200 people Saturday as it tore through large parts of Nepal, toppling office blocks and towers in Kathmandu and triggering a deadly avalanche at Everest base camp.

“We are trying to assess how many are injured. There might be over 1,000 people there right now, including foreign climbers and Nepalese supporting staff.”

AFP Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly, on an assignment to Everest together with a colleague, was among those caught up in the chaos.

“We are both ok… snowing here so no choppers coming,” she said in an SMS on an approach to base camp. “I hurt my hand – got it bandaged and told to keep it upright to stop the bleeding.”

Experienced mountaineers said panic erupted at base camp which had been “severely damaged”, while one described the avalanche as “huge”.

“Huge disaster. Helped searched and rescued victims through huge debris area. Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap,” tweeted Romanian climber Alex Gavan from base camp.

Historic tower collapses

Kathmandu was severely damaged, and the historic nine-storey Dharahara tower, a major tourist attraction, was among buildings brought down.

At least a dozen bodies were taken away from the ruins of the 19th-century tower, according to an AFP photographer who saw similar scenes of multiple casualties throughout the city.

“It was difficult to breath, but I slowly moved the debris. Someone then pulled me out. I don’t know where my friends are,” Dharmu Subedi, 36, who was standing outside the tower when it collapsed, said from a hospital bed.

At least 42 people were known to have died in India, including 30 in the eastern state of Bihar, while buildings in the capital New Delhi had to be evacuated.

The United States Geological Survey said the shallow quake struck 77 kilometres (48 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 0611 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside their homes.

The quake tore through the middle of highways in the capital and also caused damage to the country’s only international airport which was briefly closed.

Aftershock tremors could be felt more than two hours after the initial quake.

USGS initially measured the quake at 7.5 magnitude and later adjusted it to 7.8, with a depth of 15 kilometres.

Nepal and the rest of the Himalayas are particularly prone to earthquakes because of the collision of the Indian and Eurasia plates.

The thrust of the India plate beneath Eurasia generates a large amount of seismic activity, the USGS says on its website.

Tremors felt across region

A spokesman for Nepal’s home ministry said the government had released around $500 million as emergency funds for rescue operations.

India dispatched two military transport planes to help with the rescue and relief efforts and there were similar offers from around the region, including Sri Lanka and Pakistan.

The US Agency for International Development (USAID) said a disaster response was being flown to Nepal and that the Obama administration had authorised an initial $1 million “to address immediate needs.”

In Europe, Britain, Germany, Norway and Spain also pledged support and assistance.

Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a message of condolences to his Nepalese counterpart Ram Baran Yadav and offered to provide assistance.

China’s official Xinhua news agency said that 13 people, including an 83-year-old woman, were killed in the Tibet region.

The area has a history of earthquakes, with a 6.8 magnitude quake that hit eastern Nepal in August 1988 killing 721 people. A magnitude 8.1 quake killed 10,700 people in Nepal and eastern India in 1934.

UPDATES THROUGHOUT

by Paavan MATHEMA

Hundreds of people were feared killed in Nepal Saturday after a massive 7.9 magnitude earthquake ripped through large parts of the country, toppling office blocks and towers in the panic-stricken capital Kathmandu.

Officials said that at least 114 people are known to have died in Nepal but that the toll could be many times higher, while casualties were also reported in neighbouring India and Bangladesh.

There were also reports of an avalanche at Mount Everest’s base camp in Nepal where scores of mountaineers have gathered at the start of the annual climbing season.

“In Kathmandu 71 have been reported dead so far,” home ministry spokesman Laxmi Prasad Dhakal told AFP as the scale of the disaster began to emerge. Another 43 had been reported dead in the nearby Bhaktapur district, he added.

At least a dozen bodies were taken away from the ruins of Kathmandu’s landmark Dharahara tower, according to an AFP photographer who saw similar scenes of multiple casualties in other parts of the city.

While contact with Nepal was sporadic, a senior Nepalese diplomat warned that the final toll could run into many hundreds.

“We have received reports that there is a big loss of property and life in Nepal,” Krishna Prasad Dhakal, the deputy chief of mission at Nepal’s Embassy in New Delhi, told AFP.

“Possibly hundreds of people have died in various parts of the country, particularly in Kathmandu and Pokhara.”

At least three people were known to have died in northern India while buildings in the capital New Delhi had to be evacuated.

The United States Geological Survey and India’s meteorogical service said the shallow quake struck 81 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 0611 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside their homes.

“The walls of houses have collapsed around me onto the road. All the families are outside in their yards huddled together,” an AFP reporter said in Kathmandu.

Another resident recounted scenes of panic and mayhem.

“Everything started shaking. Everything fell down. The walls around the main road have collapsed. The national stadium’s gates have collapsed,” Anupa Shrestha said.

Police confirmed that the damage had been extensive.

“Our focus is on rescue in the core areas of Kathmandu where the population is concentrated,” said metropolitan police spokesman Dinesh Acharya.

“Many houses and buildings have collapsed,” he told AFP.

The quake tore through the middle of highways in the capital and also caused damage to the country’s only international airport, in a potential blow to relief efforts.

The airport’s general manager, Birendra Prasad Shrestha, said it would remain closed “for safety reasons” at least until later in the afternoon.

Kari Cuelenaere, an official at the Dutch embassy, said that the impact had swept the water out of a swimming pool at a Kathmandu hotel where Dutch national was being celebrated.

“It was horrible, all of a sudden all the water came up out of the pool and drenched everyone, the children started screaming,” Cuelenaere told AFP.

“Some parts of the city fell down, there was dust rising… There were many (rescue) helicopters.

“I can still see many high-rise buildings standing, I think we were lucky,” added Cuelenaere.

Aftershock tremors could be felt more than two hours after the initial quake.

Initially measured at 7.5 magnitude, the quake was later adjusted to 7.9, with a depth of 15 kilometres, the USGS said. It hit 68 kilometres east of the tourist town of Pokhara.

– Tremors felt across region –

Witnesses and media reports said the tremors lasted between 30 seconds and two minutes and were felt across the across the border in India, including in the capital New Delhi.

“We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet.

A massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake killed more than 1000 people on Saturday as it ripped through large parts of Nepal, toppling office blocks and towers in Kathmandu and triggering a deadly avalanche that hit Everest base camp.

""The death toll has reached 1,170,"" Nepal police spokesperson Kamal Singh Bam told AFP.

""Rescue efforts are underway,"" he added.

The death toll makes it the worst earthquake there in more than 80 years.

Emergency workers fanned out across the Himalayan nation to rescue those trapped under collapsed homes, buildings and other debris.

""Deaths have been reported from all regions except the far west. All our security personnel have been deployed to rescue and assist those in need,"" Bam told AFP.

Officials said 10 people were killed when an avalanche buried parts of Mount Everest's base camp in Nepal where hundreds of mountaineers have gathered at the start of the annual climbing season.

""We don't have the details yet, but 10 have been reported dead so far, including foreign climbers,"" Gyanendra Kumar Shrestha, an official in Nepal's tourism department, told AFP.

""An avalanche from Mt. Pumori has hit the base camp, burying a part of it,"" Shrestha said earlier.

""We are trying to assess how many are injured. There might be over 1000 people there right now, including foreign climbers and Nepalese supporting staff.""

AFP Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly, on an assignment to Everest together with a colleague, was among those caught up in the chaos.

""We are both ok...snowing here so no choppers coming,"" she said in an SMS on approach to base camp. ""I hurt my hand - got it bandaged and told to keep it upright to stop the bleeding.""

Experienced mountaineers said panic erupted at base camp which had been ""severely damaged"", while one described the avalanche as ""huge"".

""Huge disaster. Helped searched and rescued victims through huge debris area. Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap,"" tweeted Romanian climber Alex Gavan from base camp.

Historic tower collapses

But the worst damage was reported in Kathmandu, where the historic nine-storey Dharahara tower, a major tourist attraction, was among the buildings brought down.

At least a dozen bodies were taken away from the ruins of the 19th-century tower, according to an AFP photographer who saw similar scenes of multiple casualties in other parts of the city.

""It was difficult to breathe, but I slowly moved the debris. Someone then pulled me out. I don't know where my friends are,"" Dharmu Subedi (36), who was standing outside the tower when it collapsed, said from a hospital bed.

At least 34 people were known to have died in India, including 23 in the eastern state of Bihar, while buildings in the capital New Delhi had to be evacuated.

The United States Geological Survey said the shallow quake struck 77 kilometres (48 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 0611 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside their homes.

""The walls of houses have collapsed around me onto the road. All the families are outside in their yards huddled together,"" an AFP reporter said in Kathmandu.

Another resident, Anupa Shrestha, recounted scenes of panic and mayhem, saying ""everything started shaking, everything fell down"".

The quake tore through the middle of highways in the capital and also caused damage to the country's only international airport which was briefly closed.

Kari Cuelenaere, an official at the Dutch embassy, said the impact had swept the water out of a swimming pool at a Kathmandu hotel where Dutch national day was being celebrated.

""It was horrible, all of a sudden all the water came up out of the pool and drenched everyone, the children started screaming,"" Cuelenaere told AFP. ""Some parts of the city fell down, there was dust rising... There were many (rescue) helicopters.""

Aftershock tremors could be felt more than two hours after the initial quake.

USGS initially measured the quake at 7.5 magnitude and later adjusted it to 7.8, with a depth of 15 kilometres. It said in a predictor graphic that there was a 17 percent chance the quake could claim more than 100 000 lives.

Tremors felt across region

India dispatched two military transport planes to help with the rescue and relief efforts and there were similar offers from around the region, including Sri Lanka and Pakistan.

""We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal,"" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet.

China's official Xinhua news agency said that two people, including an 83-year-old woman, were killed in the Tibet region.

The earthquake was also felt across large areas of Bangladesh, triggering panic in the capital Dhaka as people rushed out onto the streets.

In the garment manufacturing hub of Savar, on the outskirts of Dhaka, at least 50 workers were injured after the quake set off a stampede in a garment factory, according to the private Jamuna television.

The area has a history of earthquakes, with a 6.8 magnitude quake that hit eastern Nepal in August 1988 killing 721 people. A magnitude 8.1 quake killed 10 700 people in Nepal and eastern India in 1934.

KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) - Tens of thousands of people were spending the night in the open under a chilly and thunderous sky after a powerful earthquake devastated Nepal on Saturday, killing nearly 1,400, collapsing modern houses and ancient temples and triggering a landslide on Mount Everest. Officials warned the death toll would rise as more reports came in from far-flung areas.



Inspector Yuvraj Khadka of Nepal's national police force said that rescue effort was continuing through the night and the death toll had reached 1,394 people. The magnitude 7.8 earthquake, which originated outside the capital Kathmandu, was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years. It strong enough to be felt all across the northern part of neighboring India, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan, where a total of 50 people died.



As Nepal trembled, residents fled homes and buildings in panic. Walls tumbled, trees swayed, power lines came crashing down and large cracks opened up on streets and walls. Clouds of dust began to swirl all around.



Within hours of the quake, hospitals had filled up with hundreds of injured people. With organized relief and rescue lacking, many survivors were brought to hospitals by friends and relatives in motorized rickshaws, flatbed trucks and cars. Residents used their bare hands, crowbars and other tools to dig through rubble and rescue survivors.



More than two dozen aftershocks jolted the area after the first quake, which struck just before noon. At the time, Shrish Vaidya, who runs an advertising agency, was in his two-story house outside the capital Kathmandu with his parents.



""It is hard to describe. The house was shaking like crazy. We ran out and it seemed like the road was heaving up and down,"" Vaidya, 46, told The Associated Press. ""I don't remember anything like this before. Even my parents can't remember anything this bad.""



Once the first shaking stopped, Vaidya thought his family could return indoors by evening. But the jolts kept coming, and they felt safer outdoors.



""It's cold and windy so we are all sitting in the car listening to the news on FM radio,"" he said. ""The experts are saying it's still not safe to go back inside. No one can predict how big the next aftershock will be.""



So the family ate dinner outside with the headlights of their car providing light. Vaidya was grateful his wife and 10-year-old son were on holiday in the U.S.



In his largely affluent neighborhood of low-rise, sturdy homes in suburban Kathmandu the damage was relatively light. In other parts of the city where the buildings are older and poorly built people were not as lucky.



Forecasts called for rain and thunder showers later Saturday and Sunday and the temperatures were in the mid-50s (14 Celsius), cold enough to make camping outside uncomfortable.



Thousands of people were spending the night at Tudikhel, a vast open ground in the middle of Kathmandu, just next to the old city that is lined with historic buildings and narrow lanes. Now it is in ruins.



People lay on plastic sheets or cardboard boxes, wrapped in blankets. Mothers kept their children warm; some lit fire with whatever wood they could find. Most were eating instant noodles and cookies.



Deepak Rauniar, a shop worker who was there with his friends, said: ""We are too scared to go back to our apartment. It is surrounded closely by houses, most of them old. The houses could collapse while we are still sleeping.""



Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who was attending a summit in Jakarta, tried to rush back home but made it as far as Bangkok where his connecting flight to Kathmandu was canceled because the capital's international airport was shut down for commercial flights.



Indian Air Force planes were allowed to bring in 43 tons of relief material, including tents and foods, and nearly 200 rescuers, India's External Affairs Ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said. The planes were returning to New Delhi with Indian nationals who were stranded in Kathmandu. India's state-run Air India announced that it would begin relief flights to the Nepalese capital Sunday.



Hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overcrowded, running out of room for storing dead bodies and running out of emergency supplies, the United Nations said in a statement.



""The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise,"" U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon said. ""It is clear that very many lives have been lost. There has also been significant damage to Nepal's irreplaceable cultural heritage.""



While the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster were yet to be known, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world, and its rich Hindu culture. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, relies heavily on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.



A mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, said an avalanche swept the face of Mt. Everest after the earthquake, and government officials said at least 10 climbers were killed and 30 injured. Their nationalities were not immediately known.



Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, a Dane who was climbing the Everest with a Belgian, Jelle Veyt, said on his Facebook page that they were at Khumbu Icefall , a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow close to base camp at altitude 5,000 meters (16,500 feet), when the earthquake hit.



""Right now, it is pretty chaotic and we try to help those injured,"" Pedersen wrote in an email to Danish news agency Ritzau.



Norwegian climber Teodor Glomnes Johansen told a newspaper in Norway that people at base camp were working on saving lives.



""All those who are unharmed organize help with the rescue efforts. Men, women and Sherpas are working side by side. The job right now is to assist the doctors in the camp here,"" Glomnes Johansen told Norway's VG newspaper.



The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the quake at 7.8. It said the quake hit at 11:56 a.m. local time (0611 GMT) at Lamjung, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu. Its depth was only 11 kilometers (7 miles), the largest shallow quake since the 8.2 temblor off the coast of Chile on April 1, 2014.



The shallower the quake the more destructive power it carries.



A magnitude 7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while an 8 magnitude quake can cause tremendous damage. This means Saturday's quake - with the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 - was about 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.



The quake occurred at the boundary between the two pieces, or plates, of Earth's crust, one of which supports India to the south and the other Eurasia to the north. The Indian plate is moving at 45 millimeters (1.7 inches) a year under the Eurasian plate, and this results in earthquakes once every 500 year on an average, said Marin Clark, a geophysicist at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.



So the quake was ""definitely not a surprise,"" she said. Over millions of years, such quakes have led to the uplift of the Himalayas. Nepal suffered its worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.



The power of Saturday's tremors brought down several buildings in the center of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers.



Among them was the nine-story Dharahara Tower, one of Kathmandu's landmarks built by Nepal's royal rulers as a watchtower in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognized historical monument. It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath.



Hundreds of people buy tickets on weekends to go up to the viewing platform on the eighth story, but it was not clear how many were up there when the tower collapsed. Video footage showed people digging through the rubble of the tower, looking for survivors.



The Kathmandu Valley is listed as a World Heritage site and is a collection of seven locations around Nepal's capital that reflect the country's rich religious history. The Buddhist stupas, public squares and Hindu temples are some of the most well-known sites in Kathmandu, and now some of the most deeply mourned.



The head of the U.N. cultural agency, Irina Bokova, said in a statement that UNESCO was ready to help Nepal rebuild from ""extensive damage, including to historic monuments and buildings of the Kathmandu Valley.""



Nepali journalist and author Shiwani Neupane tweeted: ""The sadness is sinking in. We have lost our temples, our history, the places we grew up.""

An earthquake has shook the Nepal capital Kathmandu and its densely-populated surrounding area, leaving dozens of people injured.

Buildings collapsed and walls toppled after the 7.9-magnitude quake struck at noon local time, according to officials.

Resident Prachanda Sual said several buildings have fallen in the centre of the capital, including centuries-old temples.

He said he saw people running through the streets in panic. Ambulance sirens blared and government helicopters hovered overhead.

National radio warned people to stay outdoors because more aftershocks are feared. It is also asking people to maintain calm.

Old Kathmandu city is a warren of tightly-packed, narrow lanes with poorly-constructed homes piled on top of each other.

Nepal information minister Minendra Rijal told India's NDTV station that there are reports of damage in and around Kathmandu but no immediate word on casualties. He said rescue teams were on the scene.

The epicentre was 49 miles north-west of Kathmandu, Mr Rijal said. The Kathmandu Valley is densely populated with nearly 2.5 million, with the quality of buildings often poor.

An Associated Press reporter in Kathmandu said a wall in his compound collapsed and there was damage to nearby buildings.

The US Geological Survey revised the magnitude from 7.5 to 7.9.

Mohammad Shahab, a resident from Lahore, Pakistan, said he was sitting in his office when the earthquake rocked the city near the border with India.

He said the tremors continued for a while but now the situation was normal. The sustained quake also was felt in India's capital of New Delhi.

Rescuers in Nepal searched frantically on Sunday for survivors of a quake that killed more than 2,000, digging through rubble in the devastated capital Kathmandu and airlifting victims of an avalanche at Everest base camp.

Terrified residents of Kathmandu were woken by fresh aftershocks in the worst disaster to hit the impoverished Himalayan nation in more than 80 years, with many forced to spend the night trying to sleep out on the streets and open ground in tents.

Hospitals were so stretched that medics had to set up tents outside to treat patients.

The historic nine-storey Dharahara tower, a major tourist attraction, was among the buildings brought down Saturday, with at least a dozen bodies recovered from the ruins of the 19th-century tower.

Offers of help poured in from around the world, with the United States and European Union announcing they were sending in disaster response teams.

India flew out its stranded citizens in military planes while a 62-strong Chinese rescue team arrived with sniffer dogs.

National police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam said the number known to have died in Nepal had risen to 1,953 while 4,629 people had been injured.

Officials in India said the toll there now stood at 53, mainly in the eastern state of Bihar, while Chinese state media said 17 people had been killed in the Tibet region.

""We have deployed all our resources for search and rescues,"" Bam told AFP.

""Helicopters have been sent to remote areas. We are sifting through the rubble where buildings have collapsed to see if we can find anyone.""

The Red Cross said it was concerned about the fate of villages near the epicentre of the quake northwest of Kathmandu.

Officials said 17 people were so far known to have died on Mount Everest where an avalanche triggered by the earthquake buried part of base camp Saturday.

It is the deadliest disaster in Everest's history and comes almost exactly a year after an avalanche killed 16 sherpa guides.

AFP's Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly, on an assignment at base camp, reported that six helicopters had managed to reach the mountain on Sunday morning after the weather improved overnight.

- Cloud of terror -

A stunning image captured by the agency's South Asia photo chief Roberto Schmidt showed a massive cloud of snow and debris cascading onto base camp, burying scores of climbers and flattening tents.

""People being stretchered out as choppers land - half a dozen this morning,"" Kannampilly said in a text message.

""Weather clear, some snowfall.""

The country's cellphone network was working only sporadically, while large parts of the capital were without electricity.

AFP correspondents in Kathmandu reported that tremors were felt throughout the night, including one strong aftershock at dawn.

""It has been a sleepless night, how can we sleep? It has been shaking all night. We are just praying that this will end and we can return home,"" said Nina Shrestha, a 34-year-old banker who spent the night with hundreds of people on open ground in the capital's Tudhikhel district.

As rescuers sifted through the huge mounds of rubble, the hospitals were overflowing with victims who suffered multiple fractures and trauma.

""We have treated many people since yesterday, majority children,"" said Samir Acharya, a doctor at Nepal's Annapurna Neurological Hospital.

""Most patients have head injuries or fractures. Two of our patients died, two are critical.""

Acharya said medics were working out of a tent set up in a parking lot because of overflowing patients, while some patients were too scared to stay in the building.

Families had grabbed whatever possessions they could muster and sought shelter on the streets, many of which had been split asunder.

Weather forecasters warned that rain was on the way, with dark clouds looming over Kathmandu and promising more misery for displaced survivors.

Snowfalls on Saturday had thwarted efforts to airlift survivors from Everest, where around 800 mountaineers were gathered at the start of the annual climbing season, cancelled last year after the sherpa deaths.

Google executive Dan Fredinburg was one of the climbers to have been confirmed as having been killed.

Experienced mountaineers said panic erupted at base camp, which has been ""severely damaged"", while one described the avalanche as ""huge"".

""Seventeen have been reported dead so far and 61 are injured,"" said Tulsi Gautam of Nepal's tourism department which issues permits to climb the world's highest mountain.

""Those who are able are walking down. Others are being airlifted.""

- 'Just flattened me' -

Kannampilly said many of those stranded at the scene were walking down the mountain rather than risk being stuck for days.

George Foulsham, a Singapore-based marine biologist, described the moment that the disaster struck.

""I was outside, saw a white 50-storey building of white come at me. I ran and it just flattened me,"" he told AFP.

""I tried to get up and it flattened me again. I couldn't breathe, I thought I was dead. When I finally stood up, I couldn't believe it passed me over and I was almost untouched.

""I saved for years to climb Everest. It feels like the mountain is saying it's not meant to be climbed for now. Too much of a coincidence to see this twice in two years.""

Nepal and the rest of the Himalayas are particularly prone to earthquakes because of the collision of the Indian and Eurasia plates.

An 6.8 magnitude quake hit eastern Nepal in August 1988 killing 721 people, and a magnitude 8.1 quake killed 10,700 people in Nepal and India in 1934.

Gandhinagar

It’s vacation time and Gujarati tourists can be found at all possible tourist places not just across India but across the world.

It is estimated that there could be over 100 Gujarati tourists in Nepal at this time, the country that has witnessed major earthquake measuring 7.5 on richter scale today morning.

Gujarat government today announced control room number for tourists from Gujarat stranded in Nepal and their kin.

The number based in Gandhinagar are; 079-23251900/902/907/908/914/918. Through this number, the state government will be able to get information about presence of Gujaratis in Nepal, their possible location and contact details.

Chief Secretary of Gujarat speaking to media today advised the people of Gujarat to not to visit Nepal for now.

Speaking to a Gujarati news channel, one Gujarati tourist from Nepal said that they were told by Nepal administration to stay at safe place as aftershocks could continue. As Nepal airport has been shut down following earthquake, this Gujarati tourist said he was trying to reach India by road.

Gujarat Chief Minister in her twitter message said, “Massive earthquake in Nepal is saddening. Having witnessed the destruction an earthquake can cause, I hope & pray for minimum loss of lives!”

KATHMANDU, Nepal – A top Nepalese police official says at least 876 people are confirmed dead in the wake of the massive earthquake that struck outside Kathmandu.

Deputy Inspector General of Police Komal Singh Bam says that the death toll is expected to rise following Saturday’s quake.

The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.8 struck before noon and was most severely felt in the capital as well as the densely populated Kathmandu Valley. A magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit about an hour later, and smaller aftershocks continued to ripple through the region for hours.

KATHMANDU, Nepal — The death toll from the magnitude-7.9 earthquake that shook Nepal’s capital and the densely populated Kathmandu Valley before noon Saturday has climbed to 876, Nepalese police said Saturday afternoon. The toll rose to over 1,000 later in the day.

The quake collapsed houses, centuries-old temples and cut open roads in the worst tremor in the Himalayan nation in over 80 years.

Hundreds have been injured, including at least one Israeli traveler. Nepal is a very popular travel destination for Israelis.

Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman said Israel would send a plane to evacuate citizens once the airport reopens for operations, and extended an offer to Nepalese officials to send aid.

Liberman also spoke with the ambassador to Nepal, Yaron Meir, and told him he gave instructions to send reinforcements to the embassy in Kathmandu, according to a statement released by the Foreign Ministry.

The building of the Israeli embassy in Kathmandu sustained some damage and embassy staff were operating a situation room from the yard, the Foreign Ministry said, adding that staff were out on foot looking for injured Israelis since roads are blocked.

The father of the injured Israeli man told Ynet that he could not reach his son because of poor reception but knew that he was at Chabad House in Kathmandu with deep cuts on his legs and was awaiting transfer to a hospital.

A person who answered the phone at the Chabad House told Ynet that there was “total chaos” in the house as Israelis congregated there, some with minor injuries. According to the report, they were being treated by other Israelis who trained as IDF medics during their military service.

A number of avalanches swept Mount Everest as a result of the quake and initial reports said at least 8 climbers were killed.

Several buildings collapsed in the center of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers, said resident Prachanda Sual.

He said he saw people running through the streets in panic. Ambulance sirens blared and government helicopters hovered overhead.

National radio warned people to stay outdoors and maintain calm because more aftershocks were feared. A 6.6-magnitude aftershock hit about an hour after the initial quake.

Old Kathmandu city is a warren of tightly packed, narrow lanes with poorly constructed homes piled on top of each other.

Nepal’s Information Minister Minendra Rijal told India’s NDTV station that there are reports of damage in and around Kathmandu but no immediate word on casualties.

He said rescue teams were on the scene.

The epicenter was 80 kilometers (49 mile) northwest of Kathmandu, he said. The Kathmandu Valley is densely populated with nearly 2.5 million, with the quality of buildings often poor.

The US Geological Survey revised the magnitude from 7.5 to 7.9 and said the quake hit at 11:56 a.m. local time (0611 GMT) at Lamjung a shallow depth of 11 kilometers (7 miles).

Witnesses and media reports said Saturday’s quake tremors lasted between 30 seconds and two minutes and were felt across the across the border in India, including in the capital New Delhi. AP reporters in Indian cities of Lucknow in the north and Patna in the east also reported strong tremors.

Mohammad Shahab, a resident from Lahore, Pakistan, said he was sitting in his office when the earthquake rocked the city near the border with India.

He said the tremors continued for a while but now the situation was normal.

Nepal suffered its worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.

In October, two Israeli travelers were killed in Nepal when a bus plunged off a mountainside, in an accident that claimed 14 lives. That tragic incident came two weeks after four Israeli climbers were killed when a blizzard and avalanches swept the mountains of the Annapurna region in the country’s north. The avalanches resulted in 43 dead — 21 foreigners and 22 Nepalese guides, porters and villagers — and led to the largest-ever rescue operation in the country’s history.

Tremors felt across region

“We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet.

The AFP office in Delhi was evacuated twice following the quake, a correspondent said.

Laxman Singh Rathore, director-general of the Indian Meteorological Department, told reporters that the impact had been felt across large areas of northern India.

“The intensity was felt in entire north India. More intense shocks were felt in eastern UP (Uttar Pradesh) and Bihar, equally strong in sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim,” he said.

Rathore that a second tremor of a 6.6 magnitude had been recorded around 20 minutes later and centered around the same region.

“Since it is a big earthquake, there are aftershocks and people should stay cautious,” he said.

“The damage potential of any earthquake above seven magnitude is high. The duration of the earthquake tremors was different at different places. It was around 50-55 seconds long in Delhi.”

The earthquake was also felt across large areas of Bangladesh, triggering panic in the capital Dhaka as people rushed out onto the streets.

In the garment manufacturing hub of Savar, on the outskirts of Dhaka, at least 50 workers were injured after the quake set off stampede in a garment factory, according to private Jamuna television.

A high-intensity quake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale on Saturday rocked many parts of east and north India, including Delhi. The epicentre of the earthquake was in Nepal.

Tremors were felt across eastern and northern parts of India, said JL Gautam, Head Operations Seismology of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).

""Earthquake of magnitude 7.5 occurred today at 11.41 AM between latitude 28.1 North and Longitude 84.6 East. The epicentre was located in Nepal,"" an IMD statement said. The magnitude was later revised to 7.9.

The tremors, which were felt in Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab, lasted for about a minute, triggering panic and forcing people to rush out of their houses and offices.

There were no immediate reports of loss of life or damage to property in Delhi, but several houses were damaged and reports of people being injured in Nepal.

PM Narendra Modi tweeted about the earthquake, saying the government was in the process of finding out more information.

ANI also reported that after the tremors, a stampede took place in Kutchery, Varanasi.

Officials said Metro train services in Delhi were also affected due to the earthquake. Mobile phone services in Patna were also reportedly affected.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar consulted his state administration and took stock of the situation. ""Information is being collected from all districts. Everyone is on the field,"" Nitish Kumar said.

Mild tremors were felt in various parts of Uttar Pradesh, triggering panic and forcing people to rush out in the open.

Etah, Farukkhabad, Mainpuri, Hathras, Aligarh, Varanasi, Sultanpur, Rae Bareli, Faizabad and Muzaffarnagar were some of the districts that experienced the quake.

In Rajasthan, the tremors were felt in Jaipur, Jhunjhunu, Ajmer, Sikar and Bundi.

In Jaipur, people in Bapu Nagar, Barkat Nagar, Sodala and Jhotwara rushed out of their buildings in panic. However, no loss to life or property was reported.

The tremors were felt in various parts of Kolkata, especially in Lake Town, Salt Lake, Dalhousie and Park street area.

""The tremors of the earthquake which had its epicentre in Nepal region was felt here in the city and other parts of the Eastern region. The magnitude of the earthquake on the Richter Scale is 7.5 .

Reports from the districts said it was also experienced in Purulia, Bankura, Burdwan, East Midnapore and Nadia district.

No loss of life or property was reported from anywhere in Haryana and Punjab, which also felt the tremors.

DG of Meteorological Department LS Rathore also said that aftershocks of 6.6 magnitude were felt following the initial tremors. MET Director GL Gautam called the earthquake a ""massive earthquake"".

IT'S possible to make a convincing case that Subhas (2) and his brother Buddha-Bir (7) are incredibly lucky. Possible, but not easy.

IT'S possible to make a convincing case that Subhas (2) and his brother Buddha-Bir (7) are incredibly lucky. Possible, but not easy.

The young Tamang brothers lost both parents last April, for one thing: their mother and father killed instantly when a building they were working in collapsed during the earthquake.

The orphans are now living in a galvanised hut, for another. It's just the one room, with eight other people. There is no running water. Right now in the camp it is oppressively hot, in the mid 30s. Next month, monsoon season starts and parts of the camp will turn to swamp, and there isn't much hope for the basic latrine system. On top of that, Subhas and Buddha-Bir are growing boys, or should be. But food and clothes are not easy to come by - as shown by Subhas wearing a heavy fleece jacket, and little else, in the midday sun - with money in short supply. That same money shortage is likely to impact on gaining anything approaching a formal education.

So it's not immediately apparent how the brothers have won big in life's lottery. But they have.

""I don't know what might have happened to the boys if we let them go... but maybe something bad,"" explains their grandmother Maugu Tamang (45), the matriarch of the family now living in the one-room galvanised hut. ""That's what I heard. But I don't know what 'bad' would happen.""

Read more: Performing acrobatics: the circus that is fighting the slave traders Since the death of their parents, the two boys have twice come close to being trafficked to an 'orphanage' in Kathmandu. Both times a close male relative tried to push through the move, claiming it would see the boys' education paid right through secondary school.

At one point, in the chaos and upheaval just weeks after the quake, the boys were in his care. It would later emerge he had accepted a cash offer - amount unknown - for the boys. He was also trying to gain access to €3,500 in government compensation due to the boys following their parents' deaths. That's a lot of money in a country where the average annual wage is less than €800, and where one third of the population ekes out a life on less than €1 a day.

This man's attempt to get the compensation led indirectly to investigations by the Nepali government's Child Welfare Board which later found there was no orphanage, no school, and no accommodation for the two boys.

On both occasions the plans to send them to an 'orphanage' were stopped -once by the authorities, once by their grandmother. The compensation will be waiting for them when they hit 16. The young brothers are oblivious to all this, naturally. They don't say much, but Bir smiles shyly when his grandmother mentions the colourful scarf she is knitting is for him, and fearless Subhas (2) thinks nothing of jumping off a five-foot embankment in the fields farmed near the camp - and laughing to himself when he hits the ground with a thump.

Where were they going to be sent? Child trafficking is a thriving industry in Nepal, and arguably the term sanitises the reality. It is selling kids into domestic slavery, prostitution and forced labour.

It means dangerous and dirty work for little or no pay, with enforcement through threats and violence. Sexual abuse is common. Read more: Nepal one year on: Why are billions still unspent and so little rebuilt? It's a murky, complicated, distressing world, often connected with unregistered or unregulated orphanages in the capital (see panel), and targeting poverty-stricken families in rural districts.

The exploitation of trafficked children takes many forms - the market dictates, and the market is evidently strong. Nepal's national human rights commission estimates that up to 30,000 children are trafficked within and from the country each year. That's 30,000 kids forced into the sex trade, domestic slavery, sweatshops, and so on. That's roughly equivalent to the population of Kilkenny. Some non-governmental organisations - both national and international - say the figure is higher.

A US State Department report classified Nepal as a Tier 2 country, meaning the government ""does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so."" It has a way to go before it is classed as Tier 1, alongside the likes of Ireland. However, don't kid yourself that its problem only concerns the other side of the world. Earlier this month, it was revealed that children from Nepal were being offered as domestic staff to rich families as far away as Britain for approximately €6,600. And while Britain is a long way from Nepal, it is not so far from Ireland.

""The department is not aware of any reported case of human trafficking (child or adult) in Ireland where the victim is from Nepal,"" a spokesman for the Department of Justice said. Of course it is both the trafficker and the buyer's job to ensure the department is unaware. Subhas and Buddha-Bir were blessed their grandmother was found and took them in after the first attempt to sell them last summer, and refused to entertain a second attempt despite an ostensibly-tempting offer.

""The boys are doing well,"" their grandmother says. ""Some people came to take them to Kathmandu and put them in education but I said 'No'. I was given the responsibility of looking after them so that is why I did not send them."" The boys' uncle later came to the camp. It is located at Bogetar in Rasuwa, about 120km north-east of Kathmandu. The camp was built by the residents of the nearby Dandagaun village which was flattened in the quake and saw 23 deaths, including the boys' parents.

""He told me that the boys' education should not be spoiled because of this 'so-called love',"" their grandmother says with a dismissive shrug. ""But I said 'No'. ""I will try my best to feed and educate them and, if not, I will think of something. I am now working full-time, and will try my best until the last day.""

Her best is based on love and responsibility. You take heart from that. The boys are lucky. Monday marks the anniversary of the first of the two quakes which killed almost 9,000 people and left up to two million homeless. Nepali officials say more than 40,000 children either lost their parents, were injured, or were placed in a precarious situation following the disaster. Human trafficking was scarce before the quakes - with many cases unreported - and there is no comprehensive recording system in place. But natural disasters have long been seen by child traffickers in particular as an opportunity, and Nepal is no different. Unicef alone intercepted 245 children from being trafficked in just two months after the quake.

Over the last year, Nepali officials say they had intercepted 400 children moving in groups without their parents. That appears to have been a drop in the ocean. ""There are many other stories of trafficking in my head, and some of them would take your breath away (see panel above),"" says Tsewang Norbu Lama, child reintegration manager with the Umbrella Foundation - an organisation that rescues vulnerable children, and which was founded by two Irish people in 2005. ""There is no easy solution, no quick solution, because you're largely dealing with people who don't know much about the wider world but believe - or want to believe - that their children can have a better life.

A young boy begging on the streets of Kathmandu. Photo: Mark Condren

""And most parents want a better life for their children."" Generally, traffickers know exactly what they're doing as they prey on these aspirations - who to approach, how to convince, and how to get the child quickly out of reach. The rural districts around Kathmandu are most-regularly targeted, because the people are predominantly subsistence farmers with low levels of education. Convincing them there are better life opportunities elsewhere - and that they can send back money earned - doesn't require major persuasion skills. It is also easy to move children from here to Kathmandu and from there to India and further afield, if necessary. Usually a mediator will approach the families. He or she will likely be a relative, someone that the family can trust and someone with a relationship with the orphanage or traffickers. Unicef estimates somewhere between 7,000 and 15,000 girls are trafficked from Nepal each year. Some are taken overseas, as far away as South Africa and Europe. (Ruhama, an NGO which works in Ireland with women affected by sexual exploitation, said it has no record of assisting Nepali women over the past six years.) But the vast majority stay local. South Asia is the fastest-growing and second-largest region for human trafficking in the world, after East Asia, according to the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC). India, alone, is home to almost half the world's 36 million slaves, and the vast majority of these Nepali girls end up in Indian brothels where they are forced to sell their bodies in appalling conditions. In Nuwakot, for example, the natives are predominantly Tamang - an indigenous group with relatively-light skin, considered especially attractive over the open border in India. Sushila Kumal's exact whereabouts are unknown. The 15-year-old vanished from Pipaltar in Nuwakot last June after telling her family she was going to check on crops. For months there was no word. ""We don't have much but we spent it looking for her,"" her mother Sabitri Kumal says. ""But we quickly ran out of money, and we didn't find her."" As with a lot of these cases, this a murky one, with claim and counter claim both within and outside the family unit. These include a suicide, Sushila apparently turning up in India, and the teenager latterly going to school in Kathmandu. Sushila's aunt took her own life after she was questioned by police about the teenager's disappearance. It remains unclear whether she was the mediator, as some in the family openly suggest. A phone call from an anonymous man earlier this year claimed Sushila was in Faridabad in India. But no one was able to talk to her from the family, or confirm what she was doing there. ""I am afraid she might be forced into prostitution,"" her mother says. As she speaks outside her basic home, the other residents of the rural village listen in and give their frank opinions. It is obvious some feel there is more to the story than is coming out. The explanation of how the family recently learned Sushila is apparently in Kathmandu - a long-winded story involving a mix-up with a photograph - is greeted with open scepticism. In private, one of Sushila's sisters says she recently managed to talk to her briefly by phone. ""I asked her if she was happy,"" she says quietly. ""[Sushila] hesitated for a long time. Then she said 'Yes'."" Still no one has seen her, or knows what she is doing, and whether she is safe. Sushila dived under her bed when the earthquake hit last April. The roof collapsed, but she was safe. She was lucky then, but it's far from certain her luck has held. On the day of the earthquake, her little cousin Punima (7) lost both her parents. Punima was subsequently taken in by Sushila's parents and continues to live with them, despite their own poverty. They are fundamentally decent people, struggling to make ends meet. Sushila's story, a little like Nepali child trafficking in general, leaves a lot of unanswered questions, and the uncomfortable feeling that not enough people care enough about what is going on. Just who is driving this thriving market for 30,000 abused children each year? Why isn't much more being done to target them? And why are so many simply turning a blind eye to this ugly, life-destroying crime? This article was made possible with the support of the Simon Cumbers Media Fund Photos by Mark Condren *Faked death certs and false dawns There are around 800 orphanages registered in Nepal, but children's rights campaigners claim the country is home to a huge number of unregistered facilities. There were some 15,000 children living in orphanages in Kathmandu alone when the first earthquake struck on April 25 last year. However, a study by Unicef, published in 2014, found that 85pc of children at the orphanages they visited had at least one living parent. Traffickers can go to great lengths to ensure children - perhaps given up by their parents on the promise of free education or a brighter future - are considered orphans and therefore available for adoption. One common way is to buy faking death certs for parents. Another way to 'legalise' an orphan is to publish an advertisement for 'found' children in newspapers. Nepal's laws state that if no one comes forward to reclaim a child, it can be put up for adoption as an orphan. According to Unicef, orphanage owners can make between $5,000 to $25,000 on an international adoption. *The Irish battling corruption The Umbrella Foundation is a non-profit NGO set up in Nepal a decade ago by a pair of concerned Irish people. It was founded by Viva Bell and Dave Cutler in response to the growing number of corrupt children's homes or 'orphanages' in Kathmandu. The foundation describes itself as ""a safe place for children who were victims of trafficking and neglect"". Among the cases of child trafficking identified by the organisation in recent times are: - Some areas such as Gyanghphedi in Nuwakot District, about 80km east of Kathmandu, where there are no young women as they have all been trafficked in recent years - often with the knowledge of their families. The population is only in the low hundreds - but zero young women is a striking fact. ""These people are incredibly poor,"" Tsewang Norbu Lama, Umbrella project manager, says. ""Many send their daughters to work in India. They know it is prostitution, but it doesn't matter to them. It's how they think, and difficult to change. It's difficult for us to do anything there."" - A Korean religious group who visited a camp shelter in Haku in Rasuwa, in the foothills of the Langtang mountains, in May of last year and took at least three girls ""to Kathmandu"" without completing the necessary administrative or legal procedures. They remain missing. - Nine kids rescued from an unregistered 'orphanage' in Nuwakot last year. The owner was hiring the children - all under 12 - out for work in shops and restaurants. He was taking the proceeds. - A father in Gatlang in Rasuwa who sold his daughter for $15 to a neighbour to work as a domestic slave last year because he wanted money for alcohol. ""This was a relatively easy one for Umbrella to track, and she is in care,"" Tsewang says. For more information visit umbrellanepal.org

Sahil, a photographer, and Tara, a media consultant, hadn't had a holiday in two years, and selected Nepal for an adrenalin rush, complete with treks and bike rides. Yesterday, 11.56 am Nepal time, they literally saw the world crumble in front of them.As the earthquake of a 7.9 magnitude hit Nepal - its worst in 80 years - Tara and Sahil were getting a tattoo done at Hotel Yak and Yeti, in the capital Kathmandu. First the lights went off, then came the tremors, and the reality hit them when they saw a man jumping from a window of a building opposite. That's when they realised it was serious trouble.""It was crazy, the ground was shaking and the buildings were crumbling to dust in front of our eyes,"" Sahil said. ""We rushed out and saw a man jumping from a building. We saw a huge crack in the middle of our hotel building. It had cracked from the middle. Several people were buried under the debris within minutes.""The couple, like hundreds of thousands of people trapped in Kathmandu, have taken refuge in a park. No-one dares to venture indoors as there are warnings of more tremors. ""We were attending a tattoo convention with more than 70 artists from all over the world when the chandeliers hanging from the roof began swinging wildly. ""The hotels are shut, and people have lined the streets, parks, everywhere,"" Sahil said.The Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu was indefinitely shut on Saturday. However, by evening yesterday, the airlines announced the resumption of flights to Nepal from Sunday. A few airlines, such as SpiceJet, have been asked to keep aircraft ready to lift supplies and bring back stranded passengers.Around 60 people from Maharashtra are believed to be stranded in Nepal. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has directed state officials to keep in touch with them and assured all possible help, and a rescue team of 22 members from the Mumbai Fire Brigade are expected to fly to the Himalayan country.""I have instructed the state officials to be in touch with tourists from Maharashtra in Nepal and to give all the support and help to them,"" Fadnavis tweeted.The Juhu couple said they were looking forward to get out of Nepal as soon as possible, as even water was scarce. Thousands of tourists have been stranded without food and water, the couple said, adding the people had pitched tents at the parks.""As soon as we realised there was an earthquake, we started looking for water. Everything has been shut. As we walked the narrows streets, which resemble the by-lanes of Bandra, walls around us were collapsing. There are people from all over the world who are stranded. We are lucky that we had come prepared for the music festival, and carried tents, sleeping bags and sweaters,"" Sahil said.

More than four hundred people have reportedly died after a 7.9 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal, the tiny Himalayan country, which is the gateway to Mount Everest. The quake struck Saturday morning 50 miles west of Kathmandu in an area between the capital and the town of Pokhara. Its aftershocks were felt across cities in northen India.

The quake has wreaked havoc in Kathmandu, reducing notable heritage structures and other buildings in the capital to rubble. The city’s Durbar Square, a plaza where coronations of the former kingdom used to take place and which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has been extensively damaged. So has the Dharahara Tower, a popular tourist attraction, which is similar to India’s Qutab Minar. Kathmandu's airport has been closed.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi who tweeted about the earthquake shortly after it occurred, said: ""We are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal."" Deaths have been reported in Bihar, in eastern India and damage in areas of Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. India’s federal ministry of external affairs has opened a 24-hour control room to monitor the aftermath of the earthquake. Residents of Gurgaon, a township of glitzy condos and malls have reported that some of their towers were ""swaying."" Indian billionaire Ajay Piramal's wife Swati posted on Facebook that she felt the ripples even in Mumbai.

While telecom towers in Kathmandu are believed to have been hit making communication difficult, I was miraculously able to reach Binod Chaudhary, the country’s sole billionaire, on his cellphone. ‘The death toll could run into several hundreds, “ said Chaudhary in a brief conversation. The billionaire, along with two of his sons, was touring Chitwan, an area famous for its national park and jungles, where his Chaudhary Group is building a resort in partnership with India’s Taj Hotel chain.

He said it was unlikely that they could return to Kathmandu anytime soon since the roads and highways are damaged with huge cracks in them. “ It’s most unfortunate but Nepal just doesn’t have the capacity to handle such major calamities. “

Mumbai, April 25: Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan on Saturday expressed his horror over the massive damage that Nepal suffered in an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter Scale.

Bachchan posted a picture on Twitter showing a temple in Kathmandu badly damaged in the earthquake and said he and actress Zeenat Aman had shot a song sequence of 1983 film Mahaan there. The structure lied in ruins after Saturday's earthquake.

Over 150 people were feared dead in the Himalayan nation as a result of the disaster. A number of traditional sites were also destroyed.

India extended help to Nepal at the time of the crisis. National disaster relief teams and Air Force personnel were dispatched to Nepal to help the government carry out its relief operations.

Bhutan, another Himalayan neighbour of India, was however, not much affected.

As many as 35 persons from Belagavi district, who were on a company-sponsored tour to Nepal, are stated to be safe, bringing much relief to their family members here. The tour was organised by Shri Ganesh Agro Inputs in Fulbag Galli in Belagavi city.

The police headquarters and various police stations were trying to trace the members of the group, as their family members started inquiring about their safety after a massive earthquake rocked parts of Nepal on Saturday.

Chikkodi Deputy Superintendent of Police S.R. Patil and Police Sub Inspector Sangamesh Bidiginal told The Hindu that a group of 35 persons, all of whom are dealers or retailers of agro-products, had gone on tour to Nepal. The group included five persons from Chikkodi, one of whom called the Chikkodi police and confirmed that the entire 35- member group was safe and were nowhere near the areas affected by the earthquake, as they were returning and on the way to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh.

When contacted, staff at the agency confirmed that a group of 35 dealers/retailers had been sent on tour to Nepal. A company supplying them Humisolve, a soil-activator chemical compound, had sponsored the tour in recognition of their impressive sales performance.

Similarly, groups of 35 persons each from a few other districts in Karnataka were also sponsored for the Nepal tour.

The Modi government has rushed relief teams to Bihar, UP and West Bengal , but it has focussed its energies in helping Nepal out big-time.

Nearly 50 tonnes of relief material and more than 200 specialist personnel of the National Disaster Relief Force have flown in from an airbase near Delhi and started search-and-rescue operations in Nepal.

An Indian Major General JS Sandhu has flown into Kathmandu to work as the points-person between the Indian and Nepalese army to coordinate search and relief operations.

""After preliminary assessment, we will have more men, material and equipment coming in. We are already started flying in large quantities of safe drinking water for the camps as health could be an issue in the quake aftermath,"" Sandhu said.

Within hours of the earthquake, Prime Minister Narendra Modi convened a high-level meeting attended by his cabinet ministers and top bureaucrats like National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Foreign Secretary S Jaishanker.

Jaishankar said Modi, who has made India’s relations with its neighbours his top foreign policy priority, has given Indian officials a “strong message to step forward” and help Nepal out of this huge crisis.

“Today’s Earthquake has made us all very sad,” a tweet from Modi’s official account said. “Nepal’s pain is our pain,” another tweet said.

The Indian premier spoke to Nepal’s President Ram Baran Yadav and Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, assuring them of “support and assistance during this tough time"".

Modi has made two visits to Nepal in his first year in office, one for talks with the Nepalese government and another for a summit of South Asian countries. He made a very positive impact, says Nepalese commentator KC Sunil.

The Indian prime minister is looking to bolster his country’s leadership role at a time when China has made deep in-roads into countries such as Nepal and Sri Lanka.

India’s external affairs ministry says many aircrafts – including a C-130 Super Hercules and two C-17 Globemaster transports – have started flying into Nepal, carrying more than 200 specialised personnel of the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) and a mobile hospital.

These huge aircrafts loaded with 15 tonnes of relief supplies, each including heavy earth moving equipment, will fly several sorties, Indian Air Force officials said.

PK Srivastava, who is leading the NDRF teams to Nepal, said they will focus on search and rescue operations first in Kathmandu valley and then in central Nepal where villages have been badly hit.

Several Indian mobile service providers have said calls between India and Nepal will not be charged for the next few days even as public service giant BSNL said calls will only be charged at local rates.

These giant aircrafts are involved in a two way operation—carrying relief personnel and material to Nepal and pulling out stranded Indians from the Himalayan country.

""After the huge pullout operation from Yemen, this will again prove that the government cares for its own people. This is a message going out across the country,"" said a top Indian official.

Helicopters were also pressed into service to help with rescue effort and the distribution of food to people rendered homeless in rain, the officials said.

Indian Foreign Secretary Jaishankar said more aircraft would fly to Nepal in the coming days carrying ready-to-eat meals, specialised engineering teams, tents and blankets. India will also be working to bring Indian nationals home from Nepal, he said.

Here again, India may do what it did in Yemen—help other friendly countries like Bangladesh pull out its own nationals.

Sapna Kumari, the manager of the Indian under-14 women football team playing a tournament in Kathmandu, told CNN-IBN that her team of 23 was stuck in a Kathmandu hotel.

The girls from Bangladesh are also there in the same hotel.

""The Indian embassy has told me they will out out all the girls if their managers agreed to it,"" Sapna told CNN-IBN.

In the past, Indian leaders have flown in relief or offered cash to neighbours hit by disasters.

But, Modi is sending a very different message—his government will do what it takes to help a neighbour out of a major crisis like this.

""In a way, this prepares his own system for handling a similar crisis back home if that was to happen. For Modi, disaster relief operations or crisis situations like Yemen provides an opportunity to his own people and others in the neighbourhood that his is a government with a difference,"" said a top BJP official.

Nepal urged countries to send aid to help it cope with the aftermath of a devastating earthquake that killed more than 1,300 people, a toll officials said would rise as the desperate search for survivors continued into the early hours of Sunday.

Nepal urged countries to send aid to help it cope with the aftermath of a devastating earthquake that killed more than 1,300 people, a toll officials said would rise as the desperate search for survivors continued into the early hours of Sunday.

As fears of a humanitarian disaster grew, thousands of people braved freezing temperatures to sleep on pavements, in parks or in fields, too afraid to return to homes damaged by a 7.9 magnitude quake which struck at midday on Saturday.

""We have launched a massive rescue and rehabilitation action plan and lots needs to be done,"" said Information and Broadcasting Minister Minendra Rijal. ""Our country is in a moment of crisis and we will require tremendous support and aid,"" he told Indian television.

The home ministry said the death toll had reached 1,382. A police spokesman said more than 630 of them were killed in Kathmandu Valley and at least 300 more in the capital. Foreign climbers and their Nepalese guides around Mount Everest were caught by the tremors and a huge avalanche. Some took to social media to send desperate messages for assistance, warning that otherwise more people would die.

Hospitals across the impoverished nation of 28 million people struggled to cope with the dead and injured from Nepal's worst quake in 81 years, and a lack of equipment meant rescuers could look no deeper than surface rubble for signs of life. Ramesh Pokharel, a staff member of the Bhaktapur Hospital on the outskirts of Kathmandu, said that around 50 bodies were lying in a field outside.

Doctors were treating patients in a makeshift tent next to the main building, and staff were too busy to count or register names of the casualties. ""It's chaos here,"" Pokharel said.

PEOPLE STILL TRAPPED

The earthquake, centred 50 miles (80 km) east of the second city, Pokhara, was all the more destructive for being shallow.

Areas of Kathmandu were reduced to rubble, and rescue operations had still not begun in some remote areas. Among the capital's landmarks destroyed in the earthquake was the 60-metre-high (100-foot) Dharahara Tower, built in 1832 for the queen of Nepal, with a viewing balcony that had been open to visitors for the last 10 years.

A jagged stump 10 metres high was all that was left of the lighthouse-like structure. As bodies were pulled from the ruins, a policeman said up to 200 people had been trapped inside. Across the city, rescuers scrabbled through the rubble of destroyed buildings, among them ancient, wooden Hindu temples.

""I can see three bodies of monks trapped in the debris of a collapsed building near a monastery,"" Indian tourist Devyani Pant told Reuters. ""We are trying to pull the bodies out and look for anyone who is trapped."" Neighbouring India, where 44 people were reported killed in the quake and its aftershocks, was first to respond to calls for help, sending military aircraft with medical equipment and relief teams. The Indian embassy in Nepal said 285 members of the National Disaster Response Force had been sent to assist the Nepalese army in the rescue effort.

Aid groups readied staff to go to Nepal with supplies to provide clean water, sanitation and emergency food, while the United States, Britain and Pakistan were among countries providing search-and-rescue experts. TRAGEDY IN THE MOUNTAINS An Indian army mountaineering team found 18 bodies on Mount Everest, where an avalanche unleashed by the earthquake swept through base camp. More than 1,000 climbers had gathered there at the start of the climbing season.

A tourism official, Mohan Krishna Sapkota, said it was ""hard to even assess what the death toll and the extent of damage"" around Everest could be. ""The trekkers are scattered all around the base camp and some had even trekked further up. It is almost impossible to get in touch with anyone."" Around 300,000 foreign tourists were estimated to be in various parts of Nepal for the spring trekking and climbing season in the Himalayas, and officials were overwhelmed by calls from concerned friends and relatives.

Romanian climber Alex Gavan tweeted that there had been a ""huge earthquake then huge avalanche"" at Everest base camp, forcing him to run for his life. In a later tweet he made a desperate appeal for a helicopter to fly in and evacuate climbers who had been hurt: ""Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap."" Nepal, sandwiched between India and China, has had its share of natural disasters. Its worst earthquake in 1934 killed more than 8,500 people.

A massive earthquake in Nepal, felt in most parts of India, on Saturday killed three people and injured at least 70 in West Bengal, as Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called up Prime Minister Narendra Modi to apprise him about the situation.

Speaking to mediapersons in Kolkata, Banerjee expressed shock over the quake that has ravaged Nepal, leaving hundreds dead and offered her condolences to the bereaved families.

""I have spoken to the prime minister informing him about the situation in the state. Survey is being carried out on war footing to assess extent of damage and we will send him a report,"" said Banerjee.

Banerjee said she would visit north Bengal on Sunday which has been most affected by the quake.

""Three people have died in north Bengal. I will be visiting the earthquake affected areas in north Bengal on Sunday,"" Banerjee said, adding that a control room of the disaster management department has been set up.

""We are very anxious about climbers and their associates who have gone on expedition to Mount Everest. We pray for their safe return,"" said Banerjee.

According to police, two people, including a 45-year-old woman, were crushed to death in Siliguri in Darjeeling district while another man died in Ambari area of Jalpaiguri district after the tremors led to the collapse of several buildings.

""Several buildings have been affected in the quake, electric and telephones poles have been uprooted, and roads have caved in,"" Darjeeling District Magistrate Punit Yadav said.

Around 20 people with various degrees of injuries have been hospitalised across Siliguri, Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong.

At least 50 people, including many school children, were injured in building collapses in Malda district.

At least 33 students were injured when a portion of a school collapsed in Bhado. Ten pupils including three girls, sustained injuries after a portion of the Naimouja High School in Kaliachak came down.

The quake also affected polling to 91 civic bodies across the state with the process being temporarily halted in many booths in the districts of Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling, Cooch Behar, Murshidabad and Howrah among others.

The tremors created panic among voters queued up outside booth while a few elderly voters had to be given medical attention after they felt sick.

In Kolkata, the tremors triggered panic as people came out of high-rises housing several offices in the heart of the city. Metro services were also disrupted due to the earthquake and stations were evacuated.

Many residents came out of their houses in the city and its suburbs. Cracks were visible in some houses in Kolkata. Roads in several areas of the city also caved in.

He also said that the Nepal Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who had gone to Thailand on an official visit, is cutting short his sojourn and coming back immediately.

The Kathmandu airport was shut, triggering cancellation of flights from India to Kathmandu. An Indigo flight had to return to Delhi. Unconfirmed reports said avalanches on Mount Everest were triggered by the earthquake. Several mountaineers were unaccounted for, although the defence ministry in India said that a team of army climbers from India were safe, and have been asked to help in rescue operations.

People Indian Home Secretary L.C. Goel told the media that 34 people were killed in India. There were 23 dead in Bihar, three were killed in West Bengal while eight people died in Uttar Pradesh.

The tremors were felt across India, right from Srinagar to Kochi, and Jaipur to Guwahati. At least two Indians have died in Nepal.



""I can confirm only two Indian deaths now -- one in the embassy and one in a hospital,"" Ambassador Rae said.

Asked about other Indian casualties, he said it was difficult to give exact figures as the phone lines were down and it was tough to contact the proper authorities.

He said the embassy was in touch with some Indians stranded in Muktinath and Jomsom, adding that embassy officials have been dispatched to hotels and hospitals.

The ambassador said that around 250 Indians were being evacuated on Saturday night.

Kathmandu, which is a much sought after tourist destination, bore the brunt of the devastation. People watched in disbelief as a number of its old buildings, including the Dharahara - a nine-storey 19th-century tower - collapsed. There was also damage to the walls surrounding Nepal's royal palace.

The revered Pashupatinath temple did not appear to have suffered any major damage.

Ten mountaineers were killed at the Mount Everest Base Camp when the temblor triggered an avalanche, an official at the Nepal tourism ministry said.

The earth heaved and panic-stricken people rushed out of their homes and offices. IANS correspondent Anil Giri, who is based in Kathmandu, spoke of the horror.

He said over 1,000 buildings in Kathmandu have been destroyed, including historical structures. Thousands of people were out in the open. Electricity has been cut-off and wi-fi services are down. Hospitals are packed with the injured and the army is out in full force to help rescue people.

Kathmandu is a warren of tightly packed houses and narrow streets and these were filled with wailing people who panicked further as aftershocks rocked the area.

A young woman, who clutched a blood soaked handkerchief to her forehead, cried and said that she was worried about her family. She said that she did not get the time to safely escape from her home which came crashing down. ""I was terrified,"" she said at a hospital here.

A former Nepal minister said there had been ""massive damage"" at the epicentre Lamjung.

Sadbhavana Party chief Rajendra Mahto told IANS that it was difficult to estimate the loss so soon after the disaster but Kathmandu and its neighbourhood had suffered a lot of damage.

""We will need support from neighbours, especially India, and international agencies...,"" said Mahto, who was a member of the first Constituent Assembly and a minister in several administrations.



Rescuers look for victims under a building that collapsed

The Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu was indefinitely shut on Saturday, resulting in the cancellation of all the eight subsequent return flights from India bound for the capital city.

The airport, according to aviation officials in Delhi, was opened in the evening, but only for non-commercial and relief operations. Some airlines like SpiceJet said they had been asked by Indian authorities to keep an aircraft ready to lift supplies from here and bring back stranded passengers.

Soon after the quake struck, an IndiGo flight for Nepal, which had left at 11:30 a.m. from New Delhi, had to be recalled and the departures of two others were suspended, official here said. The flight of Nepalese carrier Buddha Air, bound for Varanasi, was among the eight flights that were called off.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi promptly directed dispatch of relief and rescue teams, including medical help to Nepal, as well as to the affected areas in India.

He chaired a high-level meeting to review the situation.

Modi spoke to Nepal President Ram Baran Yadav and Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who was abroad, and assured all assistance. He also spoke to the chief ministers of affected states in India like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Sikkim and Madhya Pradesh.

A meeting of the Nepal cabinet was held in the evening. It termed the earthquake a national crisis and sought international help.

India has sent two plane loads of relief material and rescue personnel to Nepal. The planes carried 45 rescue personnel and some sniffer dogs to help in rescue operations.

An air force spokesperson said that the Kathmandu airport runway was intact and aircraft could land there. All civilian flights have been cancelled.

Images showed that the quake had left the people of Nepal stunned. Besides capital Kathmandu and Besisahar in Lamjung, the cities which were affected include Bharatpur, Pokhara and Kirtipur.

Indian Ambassador Ranjit Rae told IANS that ""the old towns in the Kathmandu Valley have been affected in the earthquake"".

Witnesses said this appeared to be ""the most massive earthquake to hit central Nepal since 1934"". In that quake, which was of 8.0 magnitude and centred near Mount Everest, more than 10,000 people were reported killed. Kathmandu was all but destroyed.

In India, reports from across north India said people feared for their lives. Some of them began to pray and tried to get as far away as possible from buildings. Most ran to open grounds. Many of the high-rises saw people rush out in large numbers.

""Suddenly people started saying their heads were reeling, fans were shaking. Tables and chairs were shaking. As realisation dawned that it was an earthquake, people made a dash for the exit,"" said K. Chakraborty, an employee of a nationalised bank in Kolkata.

KATHMANDU, Nepal >> A Nepal police official says at least 1,910 people have been killed, including at least 721 in Kathmandu, in the immense weekend earthquake centered outside of the capital of the Himalayan nation.

Deputy Inspector General of Police Komal Singh Bam says the death toll is expected to climb.

Tens of thousands of people spent the night in the open under a chilly and thunderous sky after the powerful earthquake devastated Nepal on Saturday, collapsing modern houses and ancient temples and triggering a landslide on Mount Everest.

Strong aftershocks continued to jolt the region as the rescue operation got into full swing at daybreak Sunday, with workers sending out tents and relief supplies in trucks and helicopters. Most areas were without power and water.

The magnitude 7.8 earthquake, which originated outside the capital, was the worst tremor to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years. It was strong enough to be felt all across the northern part of neighboring India, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan, where a total of 60 people died.

“There were at least three big quakes at night and early morning. How can we feel safe? This is never-ending and everyone is scared and worried,” said Sundar Sah. “I hardly got much sleep. I was waking up every few hours and glad that I was alive.”

As Nepal trembled, residents fled homes and buildings in panic. Walls tumbled, trees swayed, power lines came crashing down and large cracks opened up on streets and walls. Clouds of dust began to swirl all around.

Within hours of the quake, hospitals had filled up with hundreds of injured people, and by Sunday, their numbers swelled to nearly 5,000. With organized relief and rescue lacking, many survivors were brought to hospitals by friends and relatives in motorized rickshaws, flatbed trucks and cars. Residents used their bare hands, crowbars and other tools to dig through rubble and rescue survivors.

More than two dozen aftershocks jolted the area after the first quake, which struck just before noon. At the time, Shrish Vaidya, who runs an advertising agency, was in his two-story house outside Kathmandu with his parents.

“It is hard to describe. The house was shaking like crazy. We ran out and it seemed like the road was heaving up and down,” Vaidya, 46, told The Associated Press. “I don’t remember anything like this before. Even my parents can’t remember anything this bad.”

Once the first shaking stopped, Vaidya thought his family could return indoors by evening. But the jolts kept coming, and they felt safer outdoors.

“It’s cold and windy so we are all sitting in the car listening to the news on FM radio,” he said. “The experts are saying it’s still not safe to go back inside. No one can predict how big the next aftershock will be.”

So the family ate dinner outside with the headlights of their car providing light. Vaidya was grateful his wife and 10-year-old son were on holiday in the U.S.

In his largely affluent neighborhood of low-rise, sturdy homes in suburban Kathmandu the damage was relatively light. In other parts of the city where the buildings are older and poorly built people were not as lucky.

Forecasts called for rain and thunder showers Sunday and the temperatures were in the mid-50s (14 Celsius), cold enough to make camping outside uncomfortable.

Thousands of people spent the night at Tudikhel, a vast open ground in the middle of Kathmandu, just next to the old city that is lined with historic buildings and narrow lanes. Now it is in ruins.

“We hardly slept through the night. It was cold and it rained briefly and it was uncomfortable, but I am glad I brought my family out to the open,” said Ratna Singh, a vegetable vendor who was cuddled under a blanket with his wife and son.”

“At least I knew my family were safe. Every time the ground shook at night, I thanked god my family were there with me and safe. I don’t think I am going to be sleeping inside the house anytime soon. We are all petrified.”

People lay on plastic sheets or cardboard boxes, wrapped in blankets. Mothers kept their children warm; some lit fire with whatever wood they could find. Most were eating instant noodles and cookies.

Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who was attending a summit in Jakarta, tried to rush back home but made it as far as Bangkok where his connecting flight to Kathmandu was canceled because the capital’s international airport was shut down for commercial flights.

Indian Air Force planes were allowed to bring in 43 tons of relief material, including tents and foods, and nearly 200 rescuers, India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said. The planes were returning to New Delhi with Indian nationals who were stranded in Kathmandu. India’s state-run Air India announced that it would begin relief flights Sunday.

Hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overcrowded, running out of room for storing dead bodies and running out of emergency supplies, the United Nations said in a statement.

“The reports of the devastation are still coming in and the numbers of people killed, injured and affected by this earthquake continue to rise,” U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon said. “It is clear that very many lives have been lost. There has also been significant damage to Nepal’s irreplaceable cultural heritage.”

While the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster were yet to be known, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world, and its rich Hindu culture. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, relies heavily on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.

A mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, said an avalanche after the quake swept base camp where expeditions were preparing to scale Everest, flattening tents and killing at least 10 climbers and guides and leaving an unknown number injured and missing and others cut off. Their nationalities were not immediately known.

Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, a Dane who was climbing the Everest with a Belgian, Jelle Veyt, said on his Facebook page that they were at Khumbu Icefall , a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow close to base camp at 5,000 meters (16,500 feet) when the earthquake hit.

“Right now, it is pretty chaotic and we try to help those injured,” he said.

Norwegian climber Teodor Glomnes Johansen said that people at base camp were working on saving lives.

“All those who are unharmed organize help with the rescue efforts. Men, women and Sherpas are working side by side. The job right now is to assist the doctors in the camp here,” he told Norway’s VG newspaper.

The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the quake at 7.8. It said the quake hit at 11:56 a.m. local time (0611 GMT) at Lamjung, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu. Its depth was only 11 kilometers (7 miles), the largest shallow quake since the 8.2 temblor off the coast of Chile on April 1, 2014.

The shallower the quake the more destructive power it carries.

A magnitude 7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while an 8 magnitude quake can cause tremendous damage. This means Saturday’s quake – with the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 – was about 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.

The quake occurred at the boundary between the two pieces, or plates, of Earth’s crust, one of which supports India to the south and the other Eurasia to the north. The Indian plate is moving at 45 millimeters (1.7 inches) a year under the Eurasian plate, and this results in earthquakes once every 500 year on an average, said Marin Clark, a geophysicist at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

So the quake was “definitely not a surprise,” she said. Over millions of years, such quakes have led to the uplift of the Himalayas. Nepal suffered its worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.

The power of Saturday’s tremors brought down several buildings in the center of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers.

Among them was the nine-story Dharahara Tower, one of Kathmandu’s landmarks built by Nepal’s royal rulers as a watchtower in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognized historical monument. It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath.

Hundreds of people buy tickets on weekends to go up to the viewing platform on the eighth story, but it was not clear how many were up there when the tower collapsed. Video footage showed people digging through the rubble of the tower, looking for survivors.

The Kathmandu Valley is listed as a World Heritage site and is a collection of seven locations around Nepal’s capital that reflect the country’s rich religious history. The Buddhist stupas, public squares and Hindu temples are some of the most well-known sites in Kathmandu, and now some of the most deeply mourned.

The head of the U.N. cultural agency, Irina Bokova, said in a statement that UNESCO was ready to help Nepal rebuild from “extensive damage, including to historic monuments and buildings of the Kathmandu Valley.”

Nepali journalist and author Shiwani Neupane tweeted: “The sadness is sinking in. We have lost our temples, our history, the places we grew up.”

New Delhi, Apr 25 (IBNS) Death toll in Nepal shot up to 700 as a massive earthquake measuring 7.9 magnitude struck on Saturday causing devastating damage that spread also to India.

The Nepal government declared a state of emergency to handle the situation.



The quake, said to be strongest in Nepal in 80 years also rocked many parts of India killing at least 17 people.



The epicentre of the earthquake lay 80 km (50 miles) east of Pokhara in Nepal, United States Geological Survey (USGS) said.



The quake pulled down buildings, temples and towers, felled trees and electric posts and left yawning cracks on roads across Nepal, specially in Kathmandu, the capital.



The historic Dharara Tower built in the 19th century in Kathmandu collapsed, trapping at least 50 people, Nepal media reported.



Efforts are on to recover more bodies from under heaps of rubble.



In India, the tremor was badly felt in places like Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and the northeastern states.



Reports of over 30 death came from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. While three deaths were reported from West Bengal, in Bihar 22 died, said reports.



Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to his Nepal counterpart Sushil Koirala over the massive earthquake that hit the Himalayan nation on Saturday.



""Spoke to PM Sushil Koirala, who is in transit in Bangkok on his way to Kathmandu. Assured all support & assistance during this tough time,"" Modi tweeted.

LONDON – World leaders and global charities offered condolences and emergency aid to Nepal following the earthquake Saturday while grappling to understand the scope of a disaster that left more than 1,100 dead.

With Internet and cellphone communications spotty, and many roads closed due to damage, the outside world did not yet have a clear picture of what is most needed following the devastating quake.

But it was clear that help was needed — and fast.

“We know the damage is extensive and that access into rural areas will be very, very difficult for everybody,” said Ben Pickering, Save the Children’s humanitarian adviser in Britain.

“Children will be affected in many ways. Physical injuries. Separated from families,” he said. “The priority now is understanding the scale, what the emergency needs are right now and in the coming weeks.”

Charities assembled disaster teams based on the assumption that sanitation, shelter and medical help are urgently required but the most convenient pathway into Nepal — one of the world’s poorest countries — was not available because the international airport in Kathmandu was shut down.

Doctors Without Borders said four teams would leave Sunday morning for Nepal from Bihar state in India, close to the Nepal border. The organization is also sending in 3,000 kits including medical supplies.

AmeriCares has also sent a team from India and is preparing shipments of medical aid and relief supplies. “We are prepared to help any way that we can,” said AmeriCares President and CEO Michael J. Nyenhuis. “This is a terrible tragedy and our hearts go out to the families suffering.”

Handicap International, which was already established in Nepal with 47 workers, was also offering assistance.

“One of our projects there, because it’s earthquake-prone, is to help hospital staffs, physical therapists and others to anticipate the kind of injury we tend to see after a quake,” said spokeswoman Mica Bevington. “And we’re sharing our resources, like all our wheelchairs are going to two hospitals in need.”

French aid group Doctors of the World (Medecins du monde) said it has mobilized its workers in Nepal — based in Kathmandu and Chautara to work on maternal and infant health — to help quake victims. It is sending more staffers and medical aid to the region immediately.

Mercy Corps, based in the United States, was checking on the safety of the large team it already had on the ground in Nepal and assessing the conditions there.

“As we better understand the needs on the ground, we will respond as appropriately,” said CEO Neal Keny-Guyer said.

Countries around the globe pledged aid while Pope Francis offered his prayers for the victims and those working to save them.

“His Holiness commends the souls of the victims to the loving mercy of the Almighty and he offers encouragement to the civil authorities and emergency personnel as they continue their rescue efforts and assistance to those touched by this tragedy,” Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said in a statement.

The European Union is considering “some budget support” to Nepal, according to a joint statement by the EU’s foreign policy chief, development chief and humanitarian chief. It did not provide details or amounts.

“The full extent of the casualties and damage is still unknown but reports indicate they will likely be high, both in terms of loss of life, injuries and damage to cultural heritage,” they said.

British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders also promised help for Nepal. Cameron said on Twitter that Britain “will do all we can to help those caught up in it.”

The U.S. Embassy in Nepal announced $1 million in initial aid and the U.S. Agency for International Development activated an urban search and rescue team. The U.S. State Department also set up an email address and phone number for anyone who knows of U.S. citizens needing assistance in Nepal.

“We are working closely with the government of Nepal to provide assistance and support,” said Secretary of State John Kerry. “To the people in Nepal and the region affected by this tragedy we send our heartfelt sympathies. The United States stands with you during this difficult time.”

Norwegian Foreign Minister Boerge Brende said the Scandinavian country would allocate 30 million kroner ($3.8 million) to aid work, and that the money would be sent through the United Nations and charitable organizations.

“We are following the situation closely and we will find out whether to contribute further when we know more,” Brende said in a statement.

Italy’s Foreign Ministry said it has made available 300,000 euros ($326,000) of emergency aid for earthquake victims. The aid will be channeled through the International Red Cross.

French President Francois Hollande said France is “ready to respond to requests for help and assistance” from Nepalese authorities. The tiny, wealthy country of Monaco said it would send emergency aid “in the coming hours.”

Among other countries sending condolences was Mexico, which suffered an 8.1-magnitude earthquake that killed an estimated 9,500 people in the nation’s capital in 1985. Mexico’s foreign ministry said it stood in solidarity with the government of Nepal and the relatives of the earthquake victims.

In New York, Uma Mysorekar, president of the Hindu Temple Society of North America, said the disaster requires “global assistance.”

“We fear the deaths and casualty numbers could go up for days,” she said. “We from the temple society will be collecting funds and forwarding them — as soon when we know where to send them.”

Kathmandu/New Delhi, April 25:

Over 700 people were killed and many more injured when a massive earthquake — lasting about 20 seconds — and several strong aftershocks caused widespread devastation in Nepal. India too was affected.

In Nepal, buildings came crashing down, roads cracked, telephone connectivity snapped and hospitals grappled with a large number of injured who were extricated from the rubble after the country was hit by the temblor at 11.41 a.m. India time. The epicentre of the quake was Nepal’s Lamjung district, some 75 km northwest of capital Kathmandu. As many as 15 aftershocks were felt.

Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, a senior home ministry official in Nepal, told IANS that 688 people were dead.

Indian Home Secretary L.C. Goel told the media that 34 people were killed in India. There were 23 dead in Bihar, three were killed in West Bengal while eight people died in Uttar Pradesh.

The tremors were felt across India, right from Srinagar to Kochi, and Jaipur to Guwahati.

Kathmandu, which is a much sought after tourist destination, bore the brunt of the devastation. People watched in disbelief as a number of its old buidings, including the Dharahara – a nine-storey 19th-century tower – collapsed. There was also damage to the walls surrounding Nepal’s royal palace.

The revered Pashupatinath temple did not appear to have suffered any major damage.

Unconfirmed reports said that eight mountaineers were killed at the Mount Everest Base Camp when the temblor triggered an avalanche.

The earth heaved and panic-stricken people rushed out of their homes and offices.

IANS correspondent Anil Giri, who is based in Kathmandu, spoke of the horror.

He said over 1,000 buildings in Kathmandu have been destroyed, including historical structures. Thousands of people were out in the open. Electricity has been cut-off and wi-fi services are down. Hospitals are packed with the injured and the army is out in full force to help rescue people.

Kathmandu is a warren of tightly packed houses and narrow streets and these were filled with wailing people who panicked further as aftershocks rocked the area.

A young woman, who clutched a blood soaked handkerchief to her forehead, cried and said that she was worried about her family. She said that she did not get the time to safely escape from her home which came crashing down. “I was terrified,” she said at a hospital here.

A former Nepal minister said there had been “massive damage” at the epicentre Lamjung.

Rajendra Mahto, Sadbhavana Party chief, told IANS that it was difficult to estimate the loss so soon after the disaster but Kathmandu and its neighbourhood had suffered a lot of damage.

“We will need support from neighbours, especially India, and international agencies…,” said Mahto, who was a member of the first Constituent Assembly and a minister in several administrations.

The Kathmandu airport was shut, leading to cancellation of flights from India to Nepal. An Indigo flight had to return to Delhi.

The daughter of an employee of the Indian embassy was killed when a building in the embassy complex in Kathmandu collapsed.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi promptly directed dispatch of relief and rescue teams, including medical help to Nepal, as well as to the affected areas in India.

He chaired a high-level meeting to review the situation.

Modi spoke to Nepal President Ram Baran Yadav and Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who was abroad, and assured all assistance. He also spoke to the chief ministers of affected states in India like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Sikkim and Madhya Pradesh.

A meeting of the Nepal cabinet was held in the evening. It termed the earthquake a national crisis and sought international help.

India sent two plane loads of relief material and rescue personnel to Nepal. The planes carried 45 rescue personnel and some sniffer dogs to help in rescue operations.

An air force spokesperson said that the Kathmandu airport runway was intact and aircraft could land there. All civilian flights have been cancelled.

Images showed that the quake had left the people of Nepal stunned. Besides capital Kathmandu and Besisahar in Lamjung, the cities which were affected include Bharatpur, Pokhara and Kirtipur.

Indian Ambassador Ranjit Rae told IANS that “the old towns in the Kathmandu Valley have been affected in the earthquake”.

Reports from across north India said people feared for their lives. Some of them began to pray and tried to get as far away as possible from buildings. Most ran to open grounds. Many of the high-rises saw people rush out in large numbers.

“Suddenly people started saying their heads were reeling, fans were shaking. Tables and chairs were shaking. As realisation dawned that it was an earthquake, people made a dash for the exit,” said K. Chakraborty, an employee of a nationalised bank in Kolkata.

In Kochi, an employee said: “Our office is on the seventh floor and close to 12 noon, I felt my pen moving on the table. I felt my chair was moving. I got up and saw my colleagues running.” (IANS)

Rattled by the huge loss of lives and extensive damage to property caused by Saturday's earthquake in Nepal, the Nepalese expatriates in the Kingdom are thronging the embassy with enquiries and requests to visit their country.

The quake and aftershocks continuing on Sunday have also left expatriates from north India, especially Bihar, shocked.

Harishchandra Ghimire, deputy head of mission at the Nepalese Embassy in Riyadh, told Arab News that although it was weekly-off yesterday, the staff was busy helping people and receiving hundreds of calls from throughout the Kingdom from Nepalese workers.

“The embassy is fully cooperating with the workers, mainly those from the worst affected districts of Nepal, to help them go back home in this hour of grief,” he said. “Many of them have lost their family members in the natural disaster while properties and houses of several others were completely destroyed,” he said.

“We have shortlisted dozens of such worst-affected laborers and approached their companies to get exit and re-entry on their visas,” Ghimire said, adding that they are also approaching the Saudi government to help distressed workers.

One such Nepalese worker, Kailash, who works for Saudi Manpower Services (SMASCO), has lost his sister in the quake, which killed thousands of people in Nepal and left a million homeless. He also lost his home while rest of his family members are untraceable.

Kailash, a native from Duhala near Katmandu, which is the worst-affected area, said that he tried to contact his family members, but in vain. Some of relatives have no idea about them, he said.“One of my friends in Nepal confirmed the death of my sister on Facebook,” said a visibly distraught Kailash.

“I am on a two-year contract and have completed only nine months. Hence, I have approached the embassy to help me out,” he said.

Indian expatriates from Bihar, the worst-hit Indian state, and Uttar Pradesh were deeply concerned about their relatives and houses. They are tense as their family members have been spending the nights out in the open or in tents in view of the 24-hour alert sounded by the government.

Dilshad Ali Khan, a senior teacher at Indian school, Riyadh, said, “This is the worst quake people have seen in 100 years as tremors continued at regular intervals, forcing families to spent the nights out of their homes as they feared aftershocks in view the 48-hour alert issued by the local administration.” “Moreover, the wall of my house has developed a crack, which is disturbing,” added Khan.

Abdul Qadir Khan from Bihar, said, “After years of service, I constructed a new house and I was happy. However, I am disheartened after learning that a crack has appeared in a wall of my home following the quake which claimed 42 lives in the state left hundreds injured, mostly in Sitamarhi, Darbhanga, Champaran, Sheohar and Madhubani districts.”

New Delhi, Apr 25 (IBNS) About 466 people were reported killed after a massive earthquake hit Nepal and rocked many parts of India on Saturday causing widespread devastation.

Nepal bore the brunt of the calamity accounting for at least 449 deaths counted so far and the most of destruction that pulled down buildings, temples and towers, felled trees and electric posts and left yawning cracks on roads.

In India, the death count has been put at 17 as the effect of the tremor was badly felt in places like Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and the northeastern states.

Media reports quoted Nepal police as putting the toll in the country at 449.

However, the figure may rise further as searches are on for more bodies from under the rubble of collapsed structures.

The historic Dharara Tower built in the 19th century in Kathmandu collapsed, trapping at least 50 people, Nepal media reported.

The tower had been open to visitors for the last 10 years and had a viewing balcony on its eighth floor. Witnesses spoke of dead bodies being removed from the site.

Modi convened a high level meeting with Ministers and top officials to work out agenda to reach out to the people in the affected areas.

In India, the tremor reportedly killed 17 people in different parts of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

""Seismicity in the Himalaya dominantly results from the continental collision of the India and Eurasia plates, which are converging at a relative rate of 40-50 mm/yr. Northward underthrusting of India beneath Eurasia generates numerous earthquakes and consequently makes this area one of the most seismically hazardous regions on Earth. The surface expression of the plate boundary is marked by the foothills of the north-south trending Sulaiman Range in the west, the Indo-Burmese Arc in the east and the east-west trending Himalaya Front in the north of India,"" USGS website said.
